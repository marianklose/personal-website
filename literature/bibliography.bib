  abstract = {Aims This study aims to assess approaches to handle interoccasion variability (IOV) in a model-based therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) context, using a population pharmacokinetic model of coagulation factor VIII as example. Methods We assessed 5 model-based TDM approaches: empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) from a model including IOV, with individualized doses calculated based on individual parameters either (i) including or (ii) excluding variability related to IOV; and EBEs from a model excluding IOV by (iii) setting IOV to zero, (iv) summing variances of interindividual variability (IIV) and IOV into a single IIV term, or (v) re-estimating the model without IOV. The impact of varying IOV magnitudes (0--50\%) and number of occasions/observations was explored. The approaches were compared with conventional weight-based dosing. Predictive performance was assessed with the prediction error percentiles. Results When IOV was lower than IIV, the accuracy was good for all approaches (50th percentile of the prediction error [P50] {$<$}7.4\%), but the precision varied substantially between IOV magnitudes (P97.5 61--528\%). Approach (ii) was the most precise forecasting method across a wide range of scenarios, particularly in case of sparse sampling or high magnitudes of IOV. Weight-based dosing led to less precise predictions than the model-based TDM approaches in most scenarios. Conclusions Based on the studied scenarios and theoretical expectations, the best approach to handle IOV in model-based dose individualization is to include IOV in the generation of the EBEs but exclude the portion of unexplained variability related to IOV in the individual parameters used to calculate the future dose.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Over the past decades, researchers have reported several mechanisms for doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Another mechanism that has been suggested is that DOX interferes with the cell cycle and induces oxidative stress in C-kit+ cells (commonly known as cardiac progenitor cells), reducing their regenerative capacity. Cardiac regeneration through enhancing the regenerative capacity of these cells or administration of other stem cells types has been the axis of several studies over the past 20 years. Several experiments revealed that local or systemic injections with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were associated with significantly improved cardiac function, ameliorated inflammatory response, and reduced myocardial fibrosis. They also showed that several factors can affect the outcome of MSC treatment for DOX cardiomyopathy, including the MSC type, dose, route, and timing of administration. However, there is growing evidence that the C-kit+ cells do not have a cardiac regenerative potential in the adult mammalian heart. Similarly, the protective mechanisms of MSCs against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy are not likely to include direct differentiation into cardiomyocytes and probably occur through paracrine secretion, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Better understanding of the involved mechanisms and the factors governing the outcomes of MSCs therapy are essential before moving to clinical application in patients with DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Patients were considered anthracycline resistant when they had disease progression on anthracycline therapy for MBC or within 6 months of adjuvant therapy. The overall clinical benefit rate (objective response+stable disease {$>$} or =24 weeks) was 24\% (16.1\% in patients with documented anthracycline resistance vs 29\% in patients classified as having non-anthracycline-resistant disease). There was no difference with respect to the clinical benefit between patients who received PLD {$>$}12 months and those who received PLD {$<$} or =12 months since last anthracycline treatment for metastatic disease (clinical benefit 25 vs 24.1\%, respectively). Median time to progression and overall survival were 3.6 and 12.3 months, respectively. The median duration of response was 12 months, and the median time to progression in patients with stable disease (any) was 9.5 months. Fourteen patients (17.7\%) had a prolonged clinical benefit lasting {$>$} or =12 months. In conclusion, PLD was associated with an evident clinical benefit in anthracycline-pretreated patients with MBC.},

Chemotherapy was administered according to 7 different protocols, successively activated, in which HDMTX was associated with other drugs (cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide) in different combinations. The doses of MTX ranged between 7.5 to 12 g/m2 and patients received from 1 to 10 cycles with MTX for a total number of 4219 cycles. The incidence of delayed clearance of MTX (plasma values of the drug at 24 h {$>$}5 {\textmu}M/l) was 8.6\% per patient and 1.6\% per cycle of treatment. In 51 cases the delayed clearance of MTX was `mild' (plasma values of MTX at 24 h between 5 and 19 {\textmu}M/l) and in 18 cases `severe' (plasma values of MTX at the 24 h {$>$}20 {\textmu}M/l). The delayed clearance of MTX was significantly correlated with the age of patients (16\% for patients over 20 vs. 6\% for younger patients: p=0.0001) and was significantly more frequent during the first cycles of chemotherapy (7\% during the first 3 cycles of treatment vs. 2\% during subsequent cycles). There was also a significant correlation (p=0.0001) between the plasma values of MTX at the end of the infusion and at 18 h and the delayed clearance of the drug. In addition to support treatment by increased hydration and sodium bicarbonate, all patients who experienced the delayed clearance of MTX were treated solely with a high dose of leucovorin (HDLV), which was started at the first 18 h. Significant neutropenia and/or thrombocythopenia, increase of serum creatinine, mucositis of varying degrees and vomiting occurred in most cases of severe delayed clearance of MTX, but all patients completely recovered. We conclude that in spite of adequate hydration and urine alkalinization and the use of pharmacokinetically guided leucoverin rescue, delayed clearance of MTX may still occur and that its incidence is higher in older patients and during the first cycles of treatment. However, if `rescue' treatment is started early, the consequent morbility is tolerable and these patients can be rescued using only HDLV, without the need for extracorporeal removal.},

A pharmacokinetic model may be fit to these data, and for this purpose, the BQL observations must be either discarded or handled in a special way. In this paper, seven methods for dealing with BQL observations are evaluated. Both single-subject and population data are simulated from a one-compartment model. A moderate amount of data is simulated for each individual. The actual cv of concentration measurements at the quantification limit is assumed to be no greater than 20\%, in accord with the FDA Guidance. The results of this paper should be interpreted in this context. The methods include handling BQL observations as fixed-point censored observations, i.e., by using the likelihoods that these observations are in fact BQL. This method is shown to have some overall statistical advantage. However, the gain in using this method over that of simply discarding the BQL observations is not always much, and this is especially so when the frequency of BQL observations is small. Some simple methods entailing (i) replacing one or more BQL observations with the value 0, or (ii) replacing them with the value QL/2, where QL is the quantification limit, are also included. The first of these two approaches should not be used. With population data, use of the second approach can result in some noticeably improved estimation of the typical value of a parameter, but then there is also marked degradation in the estimation of the population variance of the parameter.},

We conducted a simulation study with stochastic simulation and estimation (SSE) to evaluate the influence of IOV (25, 75\%CV) from numerous perspectives (power, type I error, accuracy and precision of parameter estimates, consequences of neglecting an IOV, capability to detect the `correct' IOV). To expand the scope from modeling-related aspects to clinical trial practice, we investigated the minimal sample size for IOV detection and calculated areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC) derived from models containing IOV and mis-specified models. The power to correctly detect an IOV increased from one to three occasions (OCC) and the type I error rate to falsely include an IOV was not elevated. Two sampling schemes were compared (with/without trough sample) and including a trough sample resulted in better performance throughout the different evaluations in this simulation study. Parameters were estimated more precisely when more OCCs were included and IOV was of high effect size. Neglecting an IOV that was truly present had a high impact on bias and imprecision of the parameter estimates, mostly on interindividual variabilities and residual error. To reach a power of {$\geq$}\,95\% in all scenarios when sampling in three OCCs between 10 and 50 patients were required in the investigated setting. AUC calculations with mis-specified models revealed a distorted AUC distribution as IOV was not considered.},

Three typical ways in which BQL can occur in a model was investigated with simulations from three different models and different levels of the limit of quantification (LOQ). Model A was used to represent a case with BQL observations in an absorption phase of a PK model whereas model B represented a case with BQL observations in the elimination phase. The third model, C, an indirect response model illustrated a case where the variable of interest in some cases decreases below the LOQ before returning towards baseline. Different approaches for handling of BQL data were compared with estimation of the full dataset for 100 simulated datasets following models A, B, and C. An improved standard for VPCs was suggested to better evaluate simulation properties both for data above and below LOQ. Omission of BQL data was associated with substantial bias in parameter estimates for all tested models even for seemingly small amounts of censored data. Best performance was seen when the likelihood of being below LOQ was incorporated into the model. In the tested examples this method generated overall unbiased parameter estimates. Results following substitution of BQL observations with LOQ/2 were in some cases shown to introduce bias and were always suboptimal to the best method. The new standard VPCs was found to identify model misfit more clearly than VPCs of data above LOQ only.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a methodology to calculate methotrexate (MTX) pharmacokinetic parameters after intramuscular administration using two samples and the population parameters. Total and free MTX were measured over a 36-h period in 56 rheumatoid arthritis patients; 14 patients were studied after a two-dose scheme at 15-day intervals. The Hill equation was used to relate the free MTX to the total MTX changes in plasma concentrations, and a two-compartment open model was used to fit the total MTX plasma concentrations. A non-linear mixed effect procedure was used to estimate the population parameters and to explore the interindividual variability in relation to the following covariables: age, weight, height, haemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count, creatinine clearance, rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, swelling joint count, and Ritchie's articular index. Population parameters were evaluated for 40 patients using a three-step approach. The population average parameters and the interindividual variabilities expressed as coefficients of variation (CV\%) were: CL, 6.94 l {$\cdot$} h-1 (20.5\%); V, 34.8 l (32.2\%); k12, 0.0838 h-1 (47.7\%); k21, 0.0769 h-1 (61.6\%); ka, 4.31 h-1 (58\%); Emax, 1.12 {$\mu$}mol {$\cdot$} l-1 (19.7\%); {$\gamma$}, 0.932 (12.3\%); and EC50, 2.14 {$\mu$}mol {$\cdot$} l-1 (27.3\%). Thirty additional data sets (16 new patients and 14 patients of the previous population but treated on a separate occasion) were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the population parameters. Twelve blood samples were collected from each individual in order to calculate individual parameters using standard fitting procedures. These values were compared to the ones estimated using a Bayesian approach with population parameters as a priori information together with two samples, selected from the individual observations. The results show that the bias was not statistically different from zero and the precision of these parameters was excellent.},

  abstract = {PurposeThe advent of new therapeutic modalities highlighted deficiencies in the traditional maximum tolerated dose approach for oncology drug dose selection and prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Project Optimus initiative, which suggests that sponsors take a holistic approach, including efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic data, in conjunction with integrated exposure-response (ER) analyses. However, this method comes with an inherent challenge of the collation of the multisource data. To address this issue, an ER-based clinical utility score (CUS) framework, combining benefit and risk into a single measurement, was developed.MethodsModel-predicted outcomes for each clinically relevant end point, informed by ER modeling, are converted to a CUS using a user-defined utility function. Thereafter, individual CUS is integrated into a single score with user-defined weighting for each end point. The user-defined weighting feature allows the user to incorporate expert knowledge/understanding into weighing the product's benefit versus risk profile.ResultsTo validate the framework, data were leveraged from over 50 oncology programs from 2019 to 2023 on the basis of FDA new drug application/biologics license application review packages and/or related literature studies. Five representative cases were selected for in-depth evaluation. Results showed that the optimal benefit-risk ratio (highest CUS) was consistently observed at PK exposures synonymous with recommended doses. A recurring theme across cases was a greater emphasis on safety over efficacy in oncology drug dose determination.ConclusionThe ER-based CUS framework offers a strategic tool to navigate the complexities of dose selection in oncology programs. It serves as a pillar to the importance of integrative data analysis, aligning with the vision of Project Optimus, and demonstrates its potential in guiding dose optimization by balancing therapeutic benefits against risk.},

These agonists also compete for 3H-enkephalin binding with shallow displacement curves, and are greatly weakened in displacing 3H-naloxone binding in the presence of sodium. These agonists differ from the other opiate classes by possessing a relatively hydrophilic component in their C-ring moieties which may provide a basis for the differential interactions of drugs with the opiate receptor.},

UGT2B7 has been shown to catalyze NSAIDs, catechol estrogens, and morphine-3- and -6-glucuronidation. cDNAs for UGT2B7Y268 and H268 were cloned and stably expressed in HK 293 cells. Studies were designed to test each form for reactivity toward a number of opioid compounds, xenobiotics such as menthol, oxazepam, and propranolol, and androgens such as androsterone and testosterone using membrane preparations derived from HK 293 cells. Both UGT2B7Y and UGT2B7H are highly reactive with many opioids, menthol, androsterone, and (R)- and (S)-propranolol, and similar kinetic values were observed. UGT2B7Y and UGT2B7H react poorly with oxazepam and no difference in (R)- or (S)-glucuronidation rate ratios was found. Thus, UGT2B7Y and H cannot account for the variability in the plasma or urine concentrations of these glucuronides in human populations. Our data suggest that UGT2B7 is a major isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of androsterone. Neither UGT2B7Y nor H catalyzes the glucuronidation of testosterone although each catalyzes the glucuronidation of epitestosterone. UGT2B7 seems to be a major human isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of opioids of the morphinan and oripavine class and is capable of catalyzing the glucuronidation of both the 3- and 6-hydroxyl moieties on these molecules. Thus, UGT2B7 plays a major role in the conversion of morphine to morphine-6-glucuronide, the potent analgesic metabolite of morphine.},

Patients were over 65 years of age or, if younger, had refused or been unsuitable for standard anthracyclines. The aims of the study were to evaluate toxicity and dose delivery with the two schedules and obtain further information on the response rate of liposomal pegylated doxorubicin as a single agent in anthracycline na{\i}{\textasciidieresis}ve advanced breast cancer. Twenty-six patients had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy (including an anthracycline in 10). Sixteen had received non-anthracycline-based first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease. One hundred and eleven patients were evaluable for toxicity and 106 for response. The delivered dose intensity (DI) was 9.8mg/m2 (95\% CI, 7.2--10.4) with 37 (69\%) achieving a DI of {$>$}90\% on ARM A and 11.9mg/m2 (95\% CI, 7.5--12.8) with 37 (65\%) achieving a DI of {$>$}90\% on ARM B. The adverse event profiles of the two schedules were distinctly different. Mucositis was more common with the every 6 weeks regimen (35\% CTC grade 3/4 in ARM A, 14\% in ARM B) but palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) was more frequent with the every 4 weeks regimen (2\% CTC grade 3/4 in ARM A, 16\% in ARM B). Confirmed objective partial responses by RECIST criteria were seen with both schedules; 15/51 (29\%) on ARM A and 17/56 (31\%) on ARM B. Liposomal pegylated doxorubicin showed significant activity in advanced breast cancer with a generally favourable side-effect profile. The high frequency of stomatitis seen with 6 weekly treatment makes this the less preferred of the two schedules tested.},

Only 35\% was excreted by dog during the first day. Stereoselectivity of 6-keto- reduction was observed for all species with the 6 beta-carbinol metabolite being most abundant in the urine of all but guinea pig.

  abstract = {Chronic pain, one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care (1), has been linked to restrictions in mobility and daily activities (2,3), dependence on opioids (4), anxiety and depression (2), and poor perceived health or reduced quality of life (2,3). Population-based estimates of chronic pain among U.S. adults range from 11\% to 40\% (5), with considerable population subgroup variation. As a result, the 2016 National Pain Strategy called for more precise prevalence estimates of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that frequently limits life or work activities) to reliably establish the prevalence of chronic pain and aid in the development and implementation of population-wide pain interventions (5). National estimates of high-impact chronic pain can help differentiate persons with limitations in major life domains, including work, social, recreational, and self-care activities from those who maintain normal life activities despite chronic pain, providing a better understanding of the population in need of pain services. To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain in the United States, CDC analyzed 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. An estimated 20.4\% (50.0 million) of U.S. adults had chronic pain and 8.0\% of U.S. adults (19.6 million) had high-impact chronic pain, with higher prevalences of both chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain reported among women, older adults, previously but not currently employed adults, adults living in poverty, adults with public health insurance, and rural residents. These findings could be used to target pain management interventions.},

  abstract = {Stan is a powerful probabilistic programming language designed mainly for Bayesian data analysis. Torsten is a collection of Stan functions that handles the events (e.g., dosing events) and solves the ODE systems that are frequently present in pharmacometric models. To perform a Bayesian data analysis, most models in pharmacometrics require Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample from the posterior distribution. However, MCMC is computationally expensive and can be time-consuming, enough so that people will often forgo Bayesian methods for a more traditional approach. This paper shows how to speed up the sampling process in Stan by within-chain parallelization through both multi-threading using Stan's reduce\_sum() function and multi-processing using Torsten's group ODE solver. Both methods show substantial reductions in the time necessary to sufficiently sample from the posterior distribution compared with a basic approach with no within-chain parallelization.},

  abstract = {Oxycodone is a widely used opioid for the management of chronic pain. Analgesic effects observed following the administration of oxycodone are mediated mostly by agonistic effects on the {$\mu$}-opioid receptor. Wide inter-subject variability observed in oxycodone efficacy could be explained by polymorphisms in the gene coding for the {$\mu$}-opioid receptor (OPRM1). In humans, oxycodone is converted into several metabolites, particularly into oxymorphone, an active metabolite with potent {$\mu$}-opioid receptor agonist activity. The CYP2D6 enzyme is principally responsible for the conversion of oxycodone to oxymorphone. The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic with encoded protein activities, ranging from non-functioning to high-functioning enzymes. Several pharmacogenetic studies have shown the importance of CYP2D6-mediated conversion of oxycodone to oxymorphone for analgesic efficacy. Pharmacogenetic testing could optimize oxycodone therapy and help achieve adequate pain control, avoiding harmful side effects. However, the most recent Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines fell short of recommending pharmacogenomic testing for oxycodone treatment. In this review, we (1) analyze pharmacogenomic and drug-interaction studies to delineate the association between CYP2D6 activity and oxycodone efficacy, (2) review evidence from CYP3A4 drug-interaction studies to untangle the nature of oxycodone metabolism and its efficacy, (3) report on the current knowledge linking the efficacy of oxycodone to OPRM1 variants, and (4) discuss the potential role of CYP2D6 brain expression on the local formation of oxymorphone. In conclusion, we opine that pharmacogenetic testing, especially for CYP2D6 with considerations of phenoconversion due to concomitant drug administration, should be appraised to improve oxycodone efficacy.},

Twelve healthy subjects were administered a single 10 mg controlled-release OM dose, followed by a periodic collection of pooled urine specimens for 54 h following administration. Analysis for free and total OM and NOM was conducted by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS), at a 50 ng/mL limit of quantitation (LOQ). Following enzymatic hydrolysis, OM and NOM were detected in 89.9\% and 13.5\% specimens, respectively. Without hydrolysis, OM was detected in 8.1\% specimens, and NOM was not detected. The mean ratio of hydrolyzed OM to NOM was 41.6. OM was frequently detected in the first pooled collection 0-2 h post-dose, appearing at a mean of 2.4 h. NOM appeared at a mean of 8.3 h. The period of detection at the 50 ng/mL threshold averaged 50.7 h for OM and 11.0 h for NOM. These data support that OM analysis conducted using a 50 ng/mL threshold should include hydrolysis or optimize sensitivity for conjugated OM.},

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Comprehensive literature searches in Medline-PubMed, Embase and SCOPUS databases. Original studies published between 2009 and 2019 with a cross-sectional design were included. The quality of the studies was assessed with Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Protocol registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews with reference number: CRD42019137990. Results: Out of the 1,310 potential studies found, 25 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were of high quality. High levels of heterogeneity were found in the studies included. In the general population, the prevalence of long-term opioid use was 2.3\% (95\% CI: 1.5-3.6\%), the prevalence of short-term opioid use was 8.1\% (95\% CI: 5.6-11.6\%), and among people with chronic low back pain it was 5.8\% (95\% CI: 0.5-45.5\%). The prevalence of opioid use among patients from the health records or medical surveys was 41\% (95\% CI: 23.3-61.3\%). Finally, in patients with musculoskeletal pain, the prevalence was 20.5\% (95\% CI: 12.9-30.9\%) and in patients with fibromyalgia, 24.5\% (95\% CI: 22.9-26.2\%). A higher prevalence of opioid use was observed among men, younger people, patients receiving prescriptions of different types of drugs, smokers and patients without insurance or with noncommercial insurance. In addition, non-white and Asian patients were less likely to receive opioids than non-Hispanic white patients. Conclusions: The prevalence of opioid use among patients with CNCP was higher in subjects with short or occasional use compared to those with long-term use. Men, younger people, more chronic pain conditions, and patients without insurance or with noncommercial insurance were most related to opioid use. However, non-white and Asian patients, and those treated by a physician trained in complementary medicine were less likely to use opioids.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the uncertainty around endpoints used for decision-making in drug development is essential. In nonlinear mixed-effects models (NLMEM) analysis, this uncertainty is derived from the uncertainty around model parameters. Different methods to assess parameter uncertainty exist, but scrutiny towards their adequacy is low. In a previous publication, sampling importance resampling (SIR) was proposed as a fast and assumption-light method for the estimation of parameter uncertainty. A non-iterative implementation of SIR proved adequate for a set of simple NLMEM, but the choice of SIR settings remained an issue. This issue was alleviated in the present work through the development of an automated, iterative SIR procedure. The new procedure was tested on 25 real data examples covering a wide range of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic NLMEM featuring continuous and categorical endpoints, with up to 39 estimated parameters and varying data richness. SIR led to appropriate results after 3 iterations on average. SIR was also compared with the covariance matrix, bootstrap and stochastic simulations and estimations (SSE). SIR was about 10 times faster than the bootstrap. SIR led to relative standard errors similar to the covariance matrix and SSE. SIR parameter 95\% confidence intervals also displayed similar asymmetry to SSE. In conclusion, the automated SIR procedure was successfully applied over a large variety of cases, and its user-friendly implementation in the PsN program enables an efficient estimation of parameter uncertainty in NLMEM.},

  abstract = {Preoperative high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) with folinic acid (leucovorin) rescue is still a mainstay in the treatment of osteosarcoma. This anticancer agent is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index and wide interpatients variability. To ensure effective and safe administration of HD-MTX, we had earlier developed an adaptive-dosing schedule with a feedback strategy. In our institute, the MTX dosage was tailored according to individual pharmacokinetics parameters, determined in real time both from two blood samples (3.5 and 4.5\,h) and from Bayesian population parameters. Up to 20\,g of MTX was safely administered as 8-h infusions. Low MTX elimination rate has, however, been reported in 15--20\% of the patients, and forecasting the MTX elimination phase and the management of leucovorin rescue is still a challenging issue in clinical oncology. This study aims at identifying the clinical or biological covariates related to impaired MTX clearance, and at validating a new limited sampling strategy (LSS), allowing for the accurate prediction of the MTX terminal elimination phase. This retrospective study was carried out on 49 patients (30 men, 19 women; mean age, 26.7 years) treated for osteosarcoma with HD-MTX. The population and individual pharmacokinetics parameters were computed, before the identification of the relevant covariates. Different LSSs were then tested, to predict accurately when the MTX plasma concentrations would drop below 0.2\,{$\mu$}mol/l, the threshold associated with the end of the rescue of leucovorin with alkaline hydration. Two main covariates (creatinemia clearance and alanine aminotransferase) were correlated with MTX clearance. Conversely, the impact of body surface area on MTX pharmacokinetics was weak, suggesting that dosing schedules based on body surface area were inadequate and potentially hazardous. A new LSS predicting accurately when the MTX concentration would reach 0.2\,{$\mu$}mol/l has been validated; blood samples are stopped as soon as the MTX concentration drops to 1\,{$\mu$}mol/l. With this LSS, our retrospective study suggests that 60\% of the patients would have left the hospital earlier than they actually did owing to a better forecasting of the MTX decrease, thus improving their quality of life while improving the cost-effectiveness for the institute. HD-MTX can be administered safely using an adaptive-dosing strategy with drug monitoring. Moreover, pharmacokinetic modeling permits the accurate forecasting of the MTX elimination profile, thus allowing for a better management of the postinfusion care of cancer patients treated with particularly high doses of this drug.},

  abstract = {Although high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is the most effective drug against primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL), outcome-determining variables related to its administration schedule have not been defined. The impact on toxicity and outcome of the area under the curve (AUCMTX), dose intensity (DIMTX) and infusion rate (IRMTX) of MTX and plasmatic creatinine clearance (CLcrea) was investigated in a retrospective series of 45 PCNSL patients treated with three different HD-MTX-based combinations. Anticonvulsants were administered in 31 pts (69\%). Age {$>$}60 years, anticonvulsant therapy, slow IRMTX ({$\leq$}800\,mgm-2h-1), and reduced DIMTX ({$\leq$}1000\,mgm-2wk-1) were significantly correlated with low AUCMTX values. Seven patients (16\%) experienced severe toxicity, which was independently associated with slow CLcrea. A total of 18 (40\%) patients achieved complete remission after chemotherapy, which was independently associated with slow CLcrea. In all, 22 patients were alive at a median follow-up of 31 months, with a 3-year OS of 40{\textpm}9\%; slow CLcrea and AUCMTX {$>$}1100\,{$\mu$}mol\,hl-1 were independently associated with a better survival. Slow CLcrea and high AUCMTX are favourable outcome-determining factors in PCNSL, while slow CLcrea is significantly related to higher toxicity. AUCMTX significantly correlates with age, anticonvulsant therapy, IRMTX, and DIMTX. These findings, which seem to support the choice of an MTX dose ⩾3\,gm-2 in a 4--6-h infusion, every 3--4 weeks, deserve to be assessed prospectively in future trials. MTX dose adjustments in patients with fast CLcrea should be investigated.},

Doxorubicin first was complexed to phosphatidylcholine and then entrapped in anionic vesicles. Quantitation of myocardial injury was accomplished through examination of thin sections of cardiac tissue by light microscopy. At treatment levels of either 20 or 40 mg/kg (total dose), mice receiving liposomal doxorubicin had toxicity scores indistinguishable from or only slightly greater than those of saline-treated controls. Similar total doses of free drug produced moderate to severe myocardial damage and yielded much higher toxicity scores. Mixture of free doxorubicin with empty liposomes did not alleviate cardiac toxicity, indicating that the drug must be entrapped within phospholipid vesicles for reduction in toxicity. The inhibition of body growth produced by free doxorubicin at both dose levels was also completely eliminated by encapsulation in liposomes. Doxorubicin liposomes were also tested for chemotherapeutic potential against L-1210 and P-388 murine leukemias. In all cases, treatment with liposomal doxorubicin produced increases in life-span greater than that observed for free drug. We conclude that anionic liposomes can function as efficacious carriers of doxorubicin. These vesicles possess improved therapeutic action as reflected by their ability to reduce cardiac toxicity, overcome growth inhibition, and increase antileukemic activity.},

Sonicated liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol were used. The lethal effect was reduced in mice treated with L-DOX as compared to mice treated with F-DOX. At a dose of 7.5 mg DOX/kg, 100\% of mice receiving the L-DOX survived a cumulative dose of 60 mg/kg administered over 98 days, while 92\% of mice receiving the F-DOX died. Two distinct patterns of death were observed: an acute phase type occurring early after injection of high doses of DOX and apparently related to gastrointestinal toxicity and a delayed phase type requiring a long latency after initial drug exposure and characterized by a complex pattern of abnormalities. Delivery of DOX by liposomes effectively protected against both types of lethal effects. Reduced toxicity of L-DOX resulted in reduced body and organ weight losses, reduced severity of pathologic changes, and fewer blood biochemical alterations. The pathological damage to the heart muscle found in mice treated with L-DOX was less severe than with F-DOX, and in some cases it was reversible. Nephrotoxicity was extremely frequent and severe among F-DOX-treated mice, while it was totally insignificant among L-DOX-treated mice. Hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, and glycogen-depleted hepatocytes were characteristic findings in mice treated with F-DOX. Altogether, the data obtained in this study indicate that liposomes significantly diminish the toxicity of DOX with the use of an intermittent schedule of chemotherapy. In addition to changes in tissue distribution as a mechanism of reduced toxicity, it is proposed that DOX associated with liposomal lipids interacts less efficiently than the free drug with target intracellular phospholipids.},

The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of Doxil in cancer patients in comparison with free DOX and examine its accumulation in malignant effusions. The pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and/or liposome-associated doxorubicin were analyzed in seven patients after injections of equivalent doses of free DOX and Doxil and in an additional group of nine patients after injection of Doxil only. Two dose levels were examined, 25 and 50 mg/m2. When possible, drug levels were also measured in malignant effusions. The plasma elimination of Doxil followed a biexponential curve with half-lives of 2 and 45 h (median values), most of the dose being cleared from plasma under the longer half-life. Nearly 100\% of the drug detected in plasma after Doxil injection was in liposome-encapsulated form. A slow plasma clearance (0.1 liter/h for Doxil versus 45 liters/h for free DOX) and a small volume of distribution (4 liters for Doxil versus 254 liters for free DOX) are characteristic of Doxil. Doxorubicin metabolites were detected in the urine of Doxil-treated patients with a pattern similar to that reported for free DOX, although the overall urinary excretion of drug and metabolites was significantly reduced. Doxil treatment resulted in a 4- to 16-fold enhancement of drug levels in malignant effusions, peaking between 3 to 7 days after injection. Stomatitis related to Doxil occurred in 5 of 15 evaluable patients and appears to be the most significant side effect in heavily pretreated patients. The results of this study are consistent with preclinical findings indicating that the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin are drastically altered using Doxil and follow a pattern dictated by the liposome carrier. The enhanced drug accumulation in malignant effusions is apparently related to liposome longevity in circulation. Further clinical investigation is needed to establish the relevance of these findings with regard to the ability of liposomes to modify the delivery of doxorubicin to solid tumors and its pattern of antitumor activity.},

The impressive reduction of cardiotoxicity conferred by PLD is the most valuable clinical asset. While PLD has gained a strong foothold in relapsed ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer, it has not been extensively tested in primary (neoadjuvant) and adjuvant therapy and has not fulfilled the expectations from the results in animal models efficacy-wise. This discrepancy may be due to the large dose gap between mice and humans and the apparent variability of the EPR effect in human cancer. PLD is a complex product and we are still in a learning curve regarding a number of factors such as its interaction with the complement system and its immune modulatory properties, as well as its integration in multimodality therapy that may potentiate its value and role in cancer therapy.},

In this study, we aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of HD-MTX in Chinese pediatric patients with ALL for designing personalized dosage regimens. In total, 4,517 MTX concentration data for 311 pediatric patients with ALL, aged 0.75--15.2 years and under HD-MTX treatment, were retrospectively collected at a tertiary Children's Hospital in China. The non-linear mixed-effect model was used to establish the population PK model, using NONMEM software. The potential effects of age, body weight, and biochemical measurements (renal and liver function) on MTX PK disposition were investigated. The model was then evaluated using goodness-of-fit, visual predictive check, and bootstrap. MTX disposition was described using a three-compartment model reasonable well. Body weight, implemented as a fixed allometric function on all clearance and volume of distribution parameters, showed a substantial improvement in model fit. The final population model demonstrated that the MTX clearance estimate in a typical child with body weight of 19 kg was 6.9 L/h and the central distribution of volume estimate was 20.7 L. The serum creatinine significantly affected the MTX clearance, with a 0.97\% increase in clearance per 1 {\textmu}mol/L of serum creatinine. Other covariates (e.g., age, sex, bilirubin, albumin, aspartate transaminase, concomitant medication) did not significantly affect PK properties of MTX. The proposed population PK model could describe the MTX concentration data in Chinese pediatric patients with ALL. This population PK model combined with a maximum a posteriori Bayesian approach could be used to estimate individual PK parameters, predict clearance, and optimize personalized MTX therapy in target patients, thus aiming to reduce toxicity and improve treatment outcomes.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and topotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma that recurred after or didn't respond to first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with measurable and assessable disease were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease.RESULTS: A total of 474 patients were treated (239 PLD and 235 topotecan). They comprised the intent-to-treat population. The overall progression-free survival rates were similar between the two arms (P = .095). The overall response rates for PLD and topotecan were 19.7\% and 17.0\%, respectively (P = .390). Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan. Data analyzed in platinum-sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for progression-free survival (P = .037), with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan. For overall survival, PLD was significantly superior to topotecan (P = .008), with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks. The platinum-refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of topotecan (P = .455). Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification, or growth factor or blood product utilization.CONCLUSION: The comparable efficacy, favorable safety profile, and convenient dosing support the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Oxycodone is a {$\mu$}-opioid receptor agonist that is mainly metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Because CYP enzymes can be inhibited by other drugs, the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone are prone to drug interactions. The aim of this study was to determine whether inhibition of CYP2D6 alone by paroxetine or inhibition of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 by a combination of paroxetine and itraconazole alters the pharmacokinetics of and pharmacological response to intravenous oxycodone. METHODS We used a randomized, three-phase, crossover, placebo-controlled study design in 12 healthy subjects. The subjects were given 0.1 \,mg/kg of intravenous oxycodone after pre-treatments with placebo, paroxetine or a combination of paroxetine and itraconazole for 4 days. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites were measured over 48 hours, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters subsequently evaluated. RESULTS The effect of paroxetine on the plasma concentrations of oxycodone was negligible. The combination of paroxetine and itraconazole prolonged the mean elimination half-life of oxycodone from 3.8 to 6.6 hours (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and increased the exposure to oxycodone 2-fold (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). However, these changes were not reflected in pharmacological response. CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that there are no clinically relevant drug interactions with intravenous oxycodone and inhibitors of CYP2D6. If both oxidative metabolic pathways via CYP3A4 and 2D6 are inhibited the exposure to intravenous oxycodone increases substantially.},

  abstract = {WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic that is metabolized mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A4 enzymes. So far, the effects of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone in humans have not been systematically studied. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Drug interactions arising from CYP2D6 inhibition most likely have minor clinical importance for oral oxycodone. When both of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 pathways are inhibited, the exposure to oral oxycodone is increased substantially. AIM The aim of this study was to find out whether the inhibition of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) with paroxetine or concomitant inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 with paroxetine and itraconazole, altered the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological response of orally administered oxycodone. METHODS A randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study design with three phases was used. Eleven healthy subjects ingested 10 mg of oral immediate release oxycodone on the fourth day of pre-treatment with either placebo, paroxetine (20 mg once daily) or paroxetine (20 mg once daily) and itraconazole (200 mg once daily) for 5 days. The plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites were measured for 48 h, and pharmacological (analgesic and behavioural) effects were evaluated. RESULTS Paroxetine alone reduced the area under concentration-time curve (AUC(0,0-48 h)) of the CYP2D6 dependent metabolite oxymorphone by 44\% (P {$<$} 0.05), but had no significant effects on the plasma concentrations of oxycodone or its pharmacological effects when compared with the placebo phase. When both oxidative pathways of the metabolism of oxycodone were inhibited with paroxetine and itraconazole, the mean AUC(0,infinity) of oxycodone increased by 2.9-fold (P {$<$} 0.001), and its C(max) by 1.8-fold (P {$<$} 0.001). Visual analogue scores for subjective drug effects, drowsiness and deterioration of performance were slightly increased (P {$<$} 0.05) after paroxetine + itraconazole pre-treatment when compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS Drug interactions arising from CYP2D6 inhibition most likely have minor clinical importance for oral oxycodone if the function of the CYP3A4 pathway is normal. When both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 pathways are inhibited, the exposure to oral oxycodone is increased substantially.},

Glucuronidation is one of the major phase II drug-metabolizing reactions that contributes to drug biotransformation. This biochemical process is also involved in the protection against environmental toxicants, carcinogens, dietary toxins and participates in the homeostasis of numerous endogenous molecules, including bilirubin, steroid hormones and biliary acids. Over the years, significant progress was made in the field of glucuronidation, especially with regard to the identification of human UGTs, study of their tissue distribution and substrate specificities. More recently, the degree of allelic diversity has also been revealed for several human UGT genes. Some polymorphic UGTs have demonstrated a significant pharmacological impact in addition to being relevant to drug-induced adverse reactions and cancer susceptibility. This review focuses on human UGTs, the description of the nature of polymorphic variations and their functional impact. The pharmacogenomic implication of polymorphic UGTs is presented, more specifically the role of UGT polymorphisms in modifying cancer risk and their impact on individual risk to drug-induced toxicities.},

  abstract = {Methotrexate (MTX)~is significantly more effective than and has a considerable advantage over placebo in patients with severe and persistent rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The drug is used to treat a variety of malignant disorders (leukemia~and~cancer of the lung, breast, and uterus) and ectopic pregnancy. As its side effects are outweighed by its effectiveness, MTX is a first-line antirheumatic drug in many countries. MTX is found in extracellular compartments, such as the synovium, as well as other organs, such as the kidney and liver. To improve treatment, increase adherence, and decrease mortality in MTX therapy, it is essential to reduce its toxicity and understand its side effects. Therefore, this comprehensive review was conducted to assist physicians and researchers in better understanding the toxicity of MTX and how to deal with this toxicity. MTX is eliminated via the kidneys, which are capable of excretion and reabsorption within the renal tubules. Although higher doses of MTX (known as high-dose MTX (HD-MTX), defined as doses of 500 mg/m2 or greater) are often more beneficial, they can produce toxicity and side effects such as bone marrow suppression, pulmonary toxicity, nephrotoxicity, hematologic toxicity, and an increased risk of infections.~Treatment of severe MTX toxicity has three main goals: clearance of MTX from the bloodstream, folinic acid therapy, and organ treatment. Leucovorin is highly beneficial in preventing myelosuppression, gastric toxicity, and neurotoxic effects after HD-MTX therapy. The preferred antidote for MTX poisoning is folinic acid.~Glucarpidase has been licensed for the treatment of high plasma MTX levels of \&gt;1 {$\mu$}mol/L in patients with compromised renal function who have delayed MTX elimination. In patients with renal deficiency, a lower initial dose is considered with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 59 mL/minute. These patients need to be monitored, and a more gradual dosage increase~and a lower weekly maximum should be considered regarding their general health situation. MTX is contraindicated in patients with RA if the eGFR is \&lt;30 mL/minute.},

METHODS Forty-two subjects were assigned to receive intravenous administration of oxycodone hydrochloride of 2.5, 5 or 10 mg. Plasma and urine samples were collected for up to 24 h after intravenous administration of oxycodone hydrochloride. RESULTS Pharmacokinetic parameters showed that mean values of C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-{$\infty$}) of oxycodone were dose dependent, whereas Tmax and t(1/2) were not. The mean AUC(0-t) ratio of noroxycodone to oxycodone ranged from 0.35 to 0.42 over three doses, and those of noroxymorphone, or oxymorphone, to oxycodone were ranging of 0.06-0.08 and 0.007-0.008, respectively. Oxycodone and its three metabolites were excreted from urine. Approximately 10\% of unchanged oxycodone was recovered in 24 h. Most adverse events (AEs) reported were mild to moderate. The frequently occurred AEs were dizziness, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and fatigue. No dose-related AEs were found. CONCLUSION Our pharmacokinetics of oxycodone injection in Chinese patients with pain strongly support continued development of oxycodone as an effective analgesic drug in China.},

METHODS Literature searches were performed using PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane Review, and Google Scholar without publication date limits. Of 264,617 articles' titles screened and abstracts reviewed, 263 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, a total of 157 were of high and moderate quality addressing pain treatment. Comprehensive literature reviews were accomplished with article abstraction, critiquing, grading, evidence table compilation, and guideline finalization by a multidisciplinary expert panel to develop evidence-based guidance. RECOMMENDATIONS No quality evidence directly supports histories, physical examinations, and opioid treatment agreements, although they are thought to be important. No quality trials were identified showing superiority of opioids, compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and other medications for treatment of chronic, noncancer pain. The use of opioid-sparing treatments associated with lower doses of postoperative opioids is also associated with better long-term functional outcomes. Selective use of opioids is recommended for patients with acute and postoperative pain. Consensus recommendations also include consideration of carefully conducted trials of chronic opioid treatment for highly select patients with subacute and chronic pain and to maintenance opioid prescriptions only if documented objective functional gain(s) results. A strong and reproducible dose-response relationship identifies a recommended morphine equivalent dose limit of no more than 50 mg/day. Higher doses should be prescribed only with documented commensurately greater functional benefit(s), comprehensive monitoring for adverse effects, informed consent, and careful consideration of risk versus benefit of such treatment. Chronic opioid use should be accompanied by informed consent, a treatment agreement, tracking of functional benefits, drug screening, and attempts at tapering.},

The authors investigated the correlation of infusion schedules with MTX penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tumor response, and survival to develop a regimen that would lead to better clinical results. METHODS: In this study, 100 mg/kg MTX was administered on either a rapid (3-hour) or regular (6-hour) infusion schedule for two or three cycles. Of 28 assessable patients, a complete or partial response was achieved in 15 (93.8\%) of 16 who received rapid and in seven (58.3\%) of 12 who received regular infusion therapy (p = 0.034). Rapid infusion significantly increased levels of MTX in the CSF (p {$<$} 0.001) and resulted in significant tumor volume reduction (p {$<$} 0.001). The mean tumor volume after the first, second, and third cycle of rapid infusion therapy was reduced to 34\%, 14\%, and 9\%, respectively, of the initial volume, whereas the corresponding values were 54\%, 42\%, and 37\% for regular infusion. The reduction between the second and third cycle was small and not significant for either schedule. Despite the longer median survival time in patients who underwent rapid MTX infusion and irradiation ({$>$} 60 compared with 20 months), the difference in survival was not significant (p = 0.147) because of the small number of patients enrolled. The median survival time was 39.3 months for all assessable patients who received high-dose MTX and radiation therapy, and the median relapse-free survival time was 35.2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid infusion enhanced both MTX penetration into the CSF and tumor response and may improve patient survival. Administration of three or more cycles of therapy should be carefully weighed in terms of cytoreductive benefits.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Establishing a dosing regimen that maximizes clinical benefit and minimizes adverse effects for novel therapeutics is a key objective for drug developers. Finding an optimal dose and schedule can be particularly challenging for compounds with a narrow therapeutic window such as in oncology. Modeling and simulation tools can be valuable to conduct in silico evaluations of various dosing scenarios with the goal to identify those that could minimize toxicities, avoid unscheduled dose interruptions, or minimize premature discontinuations, which all could limit the potential for therapeutic benefit. In this tutorial, we present a stepwise development of an adaptive dose simulation framework that can be used for dose optimization simulations. The tutorial first describes the general workflow, followed by a technical description with basic to advanced practical examples of its implementation in mrgsolve and is concluded with examples on how to use this in decision-making around dose and schedule optimization. The adaptive simulation framework is built with pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic (i.e., biomarkers, activity markers, target engagement markers, efficacy markers), and safety models that include evaluations of unexplained interindividual and intraindividual variability and covariate impact, which can be replaced and expanded (e.g., combination setting, comparator setting) with user-defined models. Subsequent adaptive simulations allow investigation of the impact of starting dose, dosing intervals, and event-driven (exposure or effect) dose modifications on any end point. The resulting simulation-derived insights can be used in quantitatively proposing dose and regimens that better balance benefit and adverse effects for further evaluation, aiding dose selection discussions, and designing dose modification recommendations, among others.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), defined as a dose higher than 500 mg/m2, is used to treat a range of adult and childhood cancers. Although HDMTX is safely administered to most patients, it can cause significant toxicity, including acute kidney injury (AKI) in 2\%--12\% of patients. Nephrotoxicity results from crystallization of methotrexate in the renal tubular lumen, leading to tubular toxicity. AKI and other toxicities of high-dose methotrexate can lead to significant morbidity, treatment delays, and diminished renal function. Risk factors for methotrexate-associated toxicity include a history of renal dysfunction, volume depletion, acidic urine, and drug interactions. Renal toxicity leads to impaired methotrexate clearance and prolonged exposure to toxic concentrations, which further worsen renal function and exacerbate nonrenal adverse events, including myelosuppression, mucositis, dermatologic toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Serum creatinine, urine output, and serum methotrexate concentration are monitored to assess renal clearance, with concurrent hydration, urinary alkalinization, and leucovorin rescue to prevent and mitigate AKI and subsequent toxicity. When delayed methotrexate excretion or AKI occurs despite preventive strategies, increased hydration, high-dose leucovorin, and glucarpidase are usually sufficient to allow renal recovery without the need for dialysis. Prompt recognition and effective treatment of AKI and associated toxicities mitigate further toxicity, facilitate renal recovery, and permit patients to receive other chemotherapy or resume HDMTX therapy when additional courses are indicated.},

Various QD doses with and without a loading dose have been evaluated in the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study. Therefore, characterization of the ritlecitinib safety profile becomes important to help inform the dose selection within the single Phase 2b/3 trial in conjunction with efficacy analysis. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of ritlecitinib with comprehensive exposure-response (ER) analyses. The concentration-QTc model was developed using a scientific white paper model, indicating no evidence of ritlecitinib-induced QTc prolongation. The semi-mechanistic PK/PD model well described the longitudinal profile of lymphocytes, indicating ritlecitinib-induced decrease in lymphocytes was marginal and the incidence of Grade 3/4 lymphopenia was predicted to be small across the investigated dose range except for a slight increase in the loading dose regimen. The ritlecitinib-dependent increase in the incidence of infections and rash was successfully described by a Poisson regression model using time-weighted average concentration as an exposure metric, indicating that the dose-dependent increase in the incidence of AEs is not dose-proportionally large in the investigated dose range. Covariate analysis within each model indicated that the safety ER relationship of ritlecitinib is similar across all the patient subgroups and no unique safety risks associated with ritlecitinib are anticipated in adolescent patients. Therefore, this comprehensive safety ER analysis supported the selection of the ritlecitinib 50 mg non-loading dose regimen for AA patients including both adults and adolescents.},

These reference values provide needed input to prospective dosimetry calculations for radiation protection purposes for both workers and members of the general public. The purpose of this report is to consolidate and unify in one publication, important new information on reference anatomical and physiological values that has become available since Publication 23 was published by the ICRP in 1975. There are two aspects of this work. The first is to revise and extend the information in Publication 23 as appropriate. The second is to provide additional information on individual variation among grossly normal individuals resulting from differences in age, gender, race, or other factors. This publication collects, unifies, and expands the updated ICRP reference values for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and consistent set of age- and gender-specific reference values for anatomical and physiological features of the human body pertinent to radiation dosimetry. The reference values given in this report are based on: (a) anatomical and physiological information not published before by the ICRP; (b) recent ICRP publications containing reference value information; and (c) information in Publication 23 that is still considered valid and appropriate for radiation protection purposes. Moving from the past emphasis on 'Reference Man', the new report presents a series of reference values for both male and female subjects of six different ages: newborn, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and adult. In selecting reference values, the Commission has used data on Western Europeans and North Americans because these populations have been well studied with respect to antomy, body composition, and physiology. When appropriate, comparisons are made between the chosen reference values and data from several Asian populations. The first section of the report provides summary tables of all the anatomical and physiological parameters given as reference values in this publication. These results give a comprehensive view of reference values for an individual as influenced by age and gender. The second section describes characteristics of dosimetric importance for the embryo and fetus. Information is provided on the development of the total body and the timing of appearance and development of the various organ systems. Reference values are provided on the mass of the total body and selected organs and tissues, as well as a number of physiological parameters. The third section deals with reference values of important anatomical and physiological characteristics of reference individuals from birth to adulthood. This section begins with details on the growth and composition of the total body in males and females. It then describes and quantifies anatomical and physiological characteristics of various organ systems and changes in these characteristics during growth, maturity, and pregnancy. Reference values are specified for characteristics of dosimetric importance. The final section gives a brief summary of the elemental composition of individuals. Focusing on the elements of dosimetric importance, information is presented on the body content of 13 elements: calcium, carbon, chloride, hydrogen, iodine, iron, magnesium, nitrogen, oxygen, potassium, sodium, sulphur, and phosphorus.},

  abstract = {Introduction: High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is an essential regimen for the treatment or prevention of central nervous system disease in hematologic malignancies. However, delayed MTX excretion is a major contributor to increased MTX toxicity and limits its use in populations such as younger individuals with good kidney function. Given the variable degrees of older age and poor renal function, there is a need to focus on developing a more precise predictive tool for delayed MTX excretion rather than avoiding HD-MTX treatment in all patients considered relatively high-risk. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for delayed MTX excretion in adult patients with hematologic diseases and establish an applicable model for clinical practice.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with acute leukemia or malignant lymphoma who received HD-MTX therapy at Kameda Medical Center between 2011 and 2023. Standard supportive care, such as adequate hydration, urine alkalinization (pH \&gt;7.0), and leucovorin rescue, was performed according to our institutional protocol. Delayed MTX excretion was defined as plasma MTX levels {$\geq$} 1 {$\mu$}mol/L at 48 h or {$\geq$} 0.1 {$\mu$}mol/L 72 h after HD-MTX infusion. Univariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for delayed MTX excretion. Variables to create a nomogram was selected using a backward stepwise selection method. The internal validation of the nomogram was conducted using the bootstrap method (1000 bootstrap resample).Results: A total of 216 patients were treated with 579 cycles (median 2, range 1-14) of HD-MTX-containing chemotherapy. The median age was 66 years (range 15-84), with male predominance (58.3\%). Most patients (82.9\%) had an underlying malignant lymphoma, and most cycles were administered at diagnosis (81\%) and for prophylactic intent (76.4\%).The delayed MTX excretion occurred 129 in 579 cycles (22.2\%); 39 (30.2\%) at 48 hours and 107 (82.9\%) at 72 hours after MTX infusion, and 17 (13.2\%) at both time points. On univariate analysis, neither the dose of MTX nor the dosing formula (3 hours drip or 24-hour continuous infusion) was a significant risk factor for MTX elimination failure. By contrast, older age (Odds ratio [OR] 1.022, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.006-1.039, P =0.009), male sex (OR 1.6 [1.05-2.42], P =0.027), levels of albumin (OR 0.44 [0.302-0.639], P \&lt;0.001), creatinine clearance (Ccr) (OR 0.99 [0.985-0.998]), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ({$\gamma$}-GTP) (OR 1.004 [1.001-1.007], P =0.005), and corrected calcium (cCa) (OR 2.746 [1.646-4.651], P \&lt;0.001) significantly associated with MTX clearance. Using backward stepwise selection, sex, albumin, Ccr, {$\gamma$}-GTP, and cCa were selected as continuous variables to create a nomogram (Figure 1). The nomogram showed the area under the curve of 0.69 (95\%CI 0.64-0.74) in predicting delayed MTX excretion (Figure 2) without significant overfitting (optimism =0.091).Finally, we evaluated the impact of MTX elimination failure on clinical outcomes. As expected, delayed MTX excretion was highly associated with the development of any grade acute kidney injury (OR 30.9 [10.6-90.1], P \&lt;0.001). Patients who experienced a delay in MTX clearance had significantly worse survival after receiving HD-MTX than those without (5-year survival rate 38\% vs. 64.5\%, P \&lt;0.001). This negative effect remained significant (hazard ratio 1.73 [1.08-2.78], P =0.02) after adjusting age and disease status on multivariate analysis.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to construct an easy-to-use nomogram based on routinely measured biochemical data and gender predicting the risk of delayed MTX excretion. Further studies are needed to validate this model and integrate the dynamic factors such as urine output and alkalinization.},

Further, the current approach requires significant manual and redundant model modifications that heavily lend themselves to automation. Within the discipline of numerical optimization it falls into the ``local search'' category. Genetic algorithms are a class of algorithms inspired by the mathematics of evolution. GAs are general, powerful, robust algorithms and can be used to find global optimal solutions for difficult problems even in the presence of non-differentiable functions, as is the case in the discrete nature of including/excluding model components in search of the best performing mixed-effects PK/PD model. A genetic algorithm implemented in an R-based NONMEM workbench for identification of near optimal models is presented. In addition to the GA capabilities, the workbench supports modeling efforts by: (1) Organizing and displaying models in tabular format, allowing the user to sort, filter, edit, create, and delete models seamlessly, (2) displaying run results, parameter estimates and precisions, (3) integrating xpose4 and PsN to facilitate generation of model diagnostic plots and run PsN scripts, (4) running regression models between post-hoc parameter estimates and covariates. This approach will further facilitate the scientist to shift efforts to focus on model evaluation, hypotheses generation, and interpretation and applications of resulting models.},

However, unbound plasma concentrations of ITZ are much lower than its reported in vitro Ki, and no clinically significant interactions would be expected based on a reversible mechanism of inhibition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reasons for the in vitro-in vivo discrepancy. The metabolism of ITZ by CYP3A4 was studied. Three metabolites were detected: hydroxy-itraconazole (OH-ITZ), a known in vivo metabolite of ITZ, and two new metabolites: keto-itraconazole (keto-ITZ) and N-desalkyl-itraconazole (ND-ITZ). OHITZ and keto-ITZ were also substrates of CYP3A4. Using a substrate depletion kinetic approach for parameter determination, ITZ exhibited an unbound K(m) of 3.9 nM and an intrinsic clearance (CLint) of 69.3 ml.min(-1).nmol CYP3A4(-1). The respective unbound Km values for OH-ITZ and keto-ITZ were 27 nM and 1.4 nM and the CLint values were 19.8 and 62.5 ml.min(-1).nmol CYP3A4(-1). Inhibition of CYP3A4 by ITZ, OH-ITZ, keto-ITZ, and ND-ITZ was evaluated using hydroxylation of midazolam as a probe reaction. Both ITZ and OH-ITZ were competitive inhibitors of CYP3A4, with unbound Ki (1.3 nM for ITZ and 14.4 nM for OH-ITZ) close to their respective Km. ITZ, OH-ITZ, keto-ITZ and ND-ITZ exhibited unbound IC50 values of 6.1 nM, 4.6 nM, 7.0 nM, and 0.4 nM, respectively, when coincubated with human liver microsomes and midazolam (substrate concentration {$<$} Km). These findings demonstrate that ITZ metabolites are as potent as or more potent CYP3A4 inhibitors than ITZ itself, and thus may contribute to the inhibition of CYP3A4 observed in vivo after ITZ dosing.},

  abstract = {AIMS In theory, the magnitude of an in vivo drug-drug interaction arising from the inhibition of metabolic clearance can be predicted using the ratio of inhibitor concentration ([I]) to inhibition constant (K(i)). The aim of this study was to construct a database for the prediction of drug-drug interactions from in vitro data and to evaluate the use of the various estimates for the inhibitor concentrations in the term [I]/K(i). METHODS One hundred and ninety-three in vivo drug-drug interaction studies involving inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2D6 or CYP2C9 were collated from the literature together with in vitro K(i) values and pharmacokinetic parameters for inhibitors, to allow calculation of average/maximum systemic plasma concentration during the dosing interval and maximum hepatic input plasma concentration (both total and unbound concentration). The observed increase in AUC (decreased clearance) was plotted against the estimated [I]/K(i) ratio for qualitative zoning of the predictions. RESULTS The incidence of false negative predictions (AUC ratio {$>$} 2, [I]/K(i) {$<$} 1) was largest using the average unbound plasma concentration and smallest using the hepatic input total plasma concentration of inhibitor for each of the CYP enzymes. Excluding mechanism-based inhibition, the use of total hepatic input concentration resulted in essentially no false negative predictions, though several false positive predictions (AUC ratio {$<$} 2, [I]/K(i) {$>$} 1) were found. The incidence of true positive predictions (AUC ratio {$>$} 2, [I]/K(i) {$>$} 1) was also highest using the total hepatic input concentration. CONCLUSIONS The use of the total hepatic input concentration of inhibitor together with in vitro K(i) values was the most successful method for the categorization of putative CYP inhibitors and for identifying negative drug-drug interactions. However this approach should be considered as an initial discriminating screen, as it is empirical and requires subsequent mechanistic studies to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a positive result.},

  abstract = {WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT {$\bullet$} High dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is the most effective drug in treating primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). {$\bullet$} While interoccasion variability of MTX elimination is moderate, interindividual variability is considerable and unpredictable. {$\bullet$} MTX dose intensity is important in patients with PCNSL to allow for an optimal clinical outcome. {$\bullet$} No dosing algorithm has yet been defined to individualize HDMTX dose and allow for targeting a prespecified dose intensity of the drug in patients with PCNSL. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS {$\bullet$} The present simulation study shows that a simple and practical dosing algorithm is able to improve the proportion of patients within a prespecified target AUCMTX. {$\bullet$} Using this dosing algorithm, 71\% of the patients received a MTX dose that was higher than the standard (500 mg m-2 over 15 min followed by 3000 mg m-2 over 3 h), while 11\% of the patients received a dose that was lower than standard. AIM There is no consensus regarding optimal dosing of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) in patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Our aim was to develop a convenient dosing algorithm to target AUCMTX in the range between 1000 and 1100 {\textmu}mol l-1 h. METHODS A population covariate model from a pooled dataset of 131 patients receiving HDMTX was used to simulate concentration--time curves of 10 000 patients and test the efficacy of a dosing algorithm based on 24 h MTX plasma concentrations to target the prespecified AUCMTX. These data simulations included interindividual, interoccasion and residual unidentified variability. Patients received a total of four simulated cycles of HDMTX and adjusted MTX dosages were given for cycles two to four. RESULTS The dosing algorithm proposes MTX dose adaptations ranging from +75\% in patients with MTX C24 {$<$} 0.5 {\textmu}mol l-1 up to -35\% in patients with MTX C24 {$>$} 12 {\textmu}mol l-1. The proposed dosing algorithm resulted in a marked improvement of the proportion of patients within the AUCMTX target between 1000 and 1100 {\textmu}mol l-1 h (11\% with standard MTX dose, 35\% with the adjusted dose) and a marked reduction of the interindividual variability of MTX exposure. CONCLUSIONS A simple and practical dosing algorithm for HDMTX has been developed based on MTX 24 h plasma concentrations, and its potential efficacy in improving the proportion of patients within a prespecified target AUCMTX and reducing the interindividual variability of MTX exposure has been shown by data simulations. The clinical benefit of this dosing algorithm should be assessed in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).},

  abstract = {High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) regimens were initially designed to overcome methotrexate (MTX) resistance due to defective transport of the drug. At high concentrations, enough MTX diffuses into resistant cells to saturate and inhibit the target enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The high doses of MTX needed to achieve these high drug concentrations must be administered with the reduced folate antidote, leucovorin (LV; 5-formyltetrahydrofolate), to prevent increased toxicity. To increase MTX therapeutic index, LV rescue must be selective, i.e., more effective in normal than in tumor cells. In experimental models, selective rescue can be achieved if strict LV administration guidelines are respected. Since both MTX and LV use the membrane transport system, it was hypothesized that selective rescue occurred because transport-deficient, MTX-resistant tumor cells also transported LV poorly. The unsatisfactory clinical results frequently obtained with HDMTX regimens suggest a need to re-evaluate this underlying rationale, especially in view of recent findings concerning the mechanisms of MTX resistance and LV rescue. Experimentally, cells resistant to MTX because of an increased or altered DHFR, decreased metabolism to polyglutamates, or decreased thymidylate synthase activity are not always significantly more sensitive to higher concentrations of MTX. Furthermore, recent studies on human small cell lung cancer cell lines suggest that decreased MTX polyglutamate metabolism and thymidylate synthase activity might be prevalent MTX-resistant mechanisms in human tumors. Selective LV rescue could also occur through mechanisms other than selective uptake by normal tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Repaglinide is an antidiabetic drug metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes. To clarify the mechanisms of observed repaglinide drug interactions, we determined the contribution of the two enzymes to repaglinide metabolism at different substrate concentrations, and examined the effect of fibrates and rifampicin on CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and repaglinide metabolism in vitro. We studied repaglinide metabolism using pooled human liver microsomes, recombinant CYP2C8 and recombinant CYP3A4 enzymes. The effect of quercetin and itraconazole on repaglinide metabolism, and of gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, fenofibrate and rifampicin on CYP2C8 (paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation) and CYP3A4 (midazolam 1-hydroxylation) activities and repaglinide metabolism were studied using human liver microsomes. At therapeutic repaglinide concentrations ({$<$}0.4 microM), CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolised repaglinide at similar rates. Quercetin (25 microM) and itraconazole (3 microM) inhibited the metabolism of 0.2 microM repaglinide by 58\% and 71\%, and that of 2 microM repaglinide by 56\% and 59\%, respectively. The three fibrates inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki: bezafibrate 9.7 microM, gemfibrozil 30.4 microM and fenofibrate 92.6 microM) and repaglinide metabolism (IC50: bezafibrate 37.7 microM, gemfibrozil 111 microM and fenofibrate 164 microM), but had no effect on CYP3A4. Rifampicin inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki 30.2 microM), CYP3A4 (Ki 18.5 microM) and repaglinide metabolism (IC50 13.7 microM). In conclusion, both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are important in the metabolism of therapeutic concentrations of repaglinide in vitro, but their predicted contributions in vivo are highly dependent on the scaling factor used. Gemfibrozil is only a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and does not inhibit CYP3A4; inhibition of CYP-enzymes by parent gemfibrozil alone does not explain its interaction with repaglinide in vivo. Rifampicin competitively inhibits both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which can counteract its inducing effect in humans.},

Analysis of simulated data with NONMEM shows that ignoring such interoccasion variability (IOV) may result in biased population parameter estimates.

Neglecting IOV also results in a high incidence of statistically significant spurious period effects. Perhaps most important, ignoring IOV can lead to a falsely optimistic impression of the potential value of therapeutic drug monitoring. A model incorporating IOV was developed and its performance in the presence and absence of IOV was evaluated. The IOV model performs well with respect to both model selection and population parameter estimation in all circumstances studied. Analysis of two real data examples using this model reveals significant IOV in all parameters for both drugs and supports the simulation findings for the case that IOV is ignored: predictable biases occur in parameter estimates and previously nonexistent period effects are found.},

This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model to characterize pediatric and adult MTX exposure across various disease types and dosing regimens, and to evaluate exposure-toxicity relationships. METHODS: MTX pharmacokinetic data from pediatric and adult patients were collected. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to determine the effects of age, liver function, renal function, and demographics on MTX disposition. The final model was used in Monte Carlo simulations to generate expected exposures for different dosing regimens. The association of toxicity, determined through chart review, and MTX area under the curve (AUC) was modeled using logistic regression. RESULTS: The analysis included 5116 MTX concentrations from 320 patients (135 adult, age 19-79~years; 185 pediatric, age 0.6-19~years). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and treatment cycle number were independent predictors of clearance (CL). CL varied 2.1-fold over the range of study eGFR values and increased 14\% for treatment cycle numbers greater than 7. Higher MTX AUC was associated with higher risk of nephrotoxicity in adults, and neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in pediatrics. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents one of the most comprehensive evaluations of HD-MTX PK across a wide range of ages and disease types. After accounting for differences in renal function, age did not impact CL, although toxicity patterns differed by age. The model allows for early identification of patients with slowed MTX clearance and at higher risk of toxicity.},

Results               Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar for PLD and comparator (PFS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95\% CI, 0.98 to 1.62; P = .11; median, 2.9 months [PLD] and 2.5 months [comparator]; OS: HR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.33; P = .71; median, 11.0 months [PLD] and 9.0 months [comparator]). In anthracycline-na{\"i}ve patients, PFS was somewhat longer with PLD, relative to the comparator (n = 44; median PFS, 5.8 v 2.1 months; HR, 2.40; 95\% CI, 1.16 to 4.95; P = .01). Most frequently reported adverse events were nausea (23\% to 31\%), vomiting (17\% to 20\%), and fatigue (9\% to 20\%) and were similar among treatment groups. PLD-treated patients experienced more palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (37\%; 18\% grade 3, 1 patient grade 4) and stomatitis (22\%; 5\% grades 3/4). Neuropathy (11\%), constipation (16\%), and neutropenia (14\%) were more common with vinorelbine. Alopecia was low in both the PLD and vinorelbine groups (3\% and 5\%).                                         Conclusion               PLD has efficacy comparable to that of common salvage regimens in patients with taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer, thereby representing a useful therapeutic option.},

  abstract = {Pharmacometrics (PM) and machine learning (ML) are both valuable for drug development to characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) analysis using PM provides mechanistic insight into biological processes but is time- and labor-intensive. In contrast, ML models are much quicker trained, but offer less mechanistic insights. The opportunity of using ML predictions of drug PK as input for a PKPD model could strongly accelerate analysis efforts. Here exemplified by rifampicin, a widely used antibiotic, we explore the ability of different ML algorithms to predict drug PK. Based on simulated data, we trained linear regressions (LASSO), Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost and Random Forest to predict the plasma concentration-time series and rifampicin area under the concentration-versus-time curve from 0--24 h (AUC0--24h) after repeated dosing. XGBoost performed best for prediction of the entire PK series (R2: 0.84, root mean square error (RMSE): 6.9 mg/L, mean absolute error (MAE): 4.0 mg/L) for the scenario with the largest data size. For AUC0--24h prediction, LASSO showed the highest performance (R2: 0.97, RMSE: 29.1 h{$\cdot$}mg/L, MAE: 18.8 h{$\cdot$}mg/L). Increasing the number of plasma concentrations per patient (0, 2 or 6 concentrations per occasion) improved model performance. For example, for AUC0--24h prediction using LASSO, the R2 was 0.41, 0.69 and 0.97 when using predictors only (no plasma concentrations), 2 or 6 plasma concentrations per occasion as input, respectively. Run times for the ML models ranged from 1.0 s to 8 min, while the run time for the PM model was more than 3 h. Furthermore, building a PM model is more time- and labor-intensive compared with ML. ML predictions of drug PK could thus be used as input into a PKPD model, enabling time-efficient analysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES Health systems (nonfederal hospitals and clinics) are the second major source for drug expenditure in the United States. Opioids prescribed in these healthcare settings are commonly short-acting opioids that can lead to persistent opioid use. Nevertheless, there are no national data that describe trends in opioid use and the associated expenditure in health systems. Therefore, the objective of this article was to describe opioid use and expenditures in US health systems from 2015 to~2019. METHODS We used data from IQVIA National Sales Perspectives to describe prescription opioid expenditure and use in health systems (nonfederal hospitals and clinics). RESULTS Over the 5-year study period, health systems dispensed a total of 6.55 billion units of opioids (26.88\% decrease) with an associated expenditure of \$3.33 billion (26.78\% decrease). Relative to all opioid formulations in our study, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl were the opioids with the highest use in US health systems. All opioid prescriptions decreased except fentanyl use, which increased by 29.80\% in clinics. The use of abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids decreased by 51.00\% over the study period, although the decrease seems to be driven mainly by long-acting oxycodone (brand name Oxycontin). CONCLUSIONS Opioid use and expenditures in health systems have been decreasing following national trends from retail pharmacies. Nevertheless, fentanyl use increased in clinics and was prescribed at higher proportions in nonfederal hospitals than other opioids, which warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In vitro experiments suggest that circulating metabolites of oxycodone are opioid receptor agonists. Clinical and animal studies to date have failed to demonstrate a significant contribution of the O-demethylated metabolite oxymorphone toward the clinical effects of the parent drug, but the role of other putative circulating active metabolites in oxycodone pharmacodynamics remains to be examined. METHODS Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone were investigated in healthy human volunteers; measurements included the time course of plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of metabolites derived from N-demethylation, O-demethylation, and 6-keto-reduction, along with the time course of miosis and subjective opioid side effects. The contribution of circulating metabolites to oxycodone pharmacodynamics was analyzed by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. The human study was complemented by in vitro measurements of opioid receptor binding and activation studies, as well as in vivo studies of the brain distribution of oxycodone and its metabolites in rats. RESULTS Urinary metabolites derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-mediated N-demethylation of oxycodone (noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and alpha- and beta-noroxycodol) accounted for 45\% +/- 21\% of the dose, whereas CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation (oxymorphone and alpha- and beta-oxymorphol) and 6-keto-reduction (alpha- and beta-oxycodol) accounted for 11\% +/- 6\% and 8\% +/- 6\% of the dose, respectively. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone were the major metabolites in circulation with elimination half-lives longer than that of oxycodone, but their uptake into the rat brain was significantly lower compared with that of the parent drug. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling indicated that the time course of pupil constriction is fully explained by the plasma concentration of the parent drug, oxycodone, alone. The metabolites do not contribute to the central effects, either because of their low potency or low abundance in circulation or as a result of their poor uptake into the brain. CONCLUSIONS CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone in humans. The central opioid effects of oxycodone are governed by the parent drug, with a negligible contribution from its circulating oxidative and reductive metabolites.},

The cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms capable of mediating the oxidation of oxycodone to oxymorphone and noroxycodone were identified using a panel of recombinant human P450s. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 displayed the highest activity for oxycodone N-demethylation; intrinsic clearance for CYP3A5 was slightly higher than that for CYP3A4. CYP2D6 had the highest activity for O-demethylation. Multienzyme, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed for both oxidative reactions in microsomes prepared from five human livers. Inhibition with ketoconazole showed that CYP3A is the high affinity enzyme for oxycodone N-demethylation; ketoconazole inhibited {$>$}90\% of noroxycodone formation at low substrate concentrations. CYP3A-mediated noroxycodone formation exhibited a mean K(m) of 600 +/- 119 microM and a V(max) that ranged from 716 to 14523 pmol/mg/min. Contribution from the low affinity enzyme(s) did not exceed 8\% of total intrinsic clearance for N-demethylation. Quinidine inhibition showed that CYP2D6 is the high affinity enzyme for O-demethylation with a mean K(m) of 130 +/- 33 microM and a V(max) that ranged from 89 to 356 pmol/mg/min. Activity of the low affinity enzyme(s) accounted for 10 to 26\% of total intrinsic clearance for O-demethylation. On average, the total intrinsic clearance for noroxycodone formation was 8 times greater than that for oxymorphone formation across the five liver microsomal preparations (10.5 microl/min/mg versus 1.5 microl/min/mg). Experiments with human intestinal mucosal microsomes indicated lower N-demethylation activity (20-50\%) compared with liver microsomes and negligible O-demethylation activity, which predict a minimal contribution of intestinal mucosa in the first-pass oxidative metabolism of oxycodone.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has transformed Bayesian model inference over the past three decades: mainly because of this, Bayesian inference is now a workhorse of applied scientists. Under general conditions, MCMC sampling converges asymptotically to the posterior distribution, but this provides no guarantees about its performance in finite time. The predominant method for monitoring convergence is to run multiple chains and monitor individual chains' characteristics and compare these to the population as a whole: if within-chain and between-chain summaries are comparable, then this is taken to indicate that the chains have converged to a common stationary distribution. Here, we introduce a new method for diagnosing convergence based on how well a machine learning classifier model can successfully discriminate the individual chains. We call this convergence measure \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$. In contrast to the predominant \${\textbackslash}widehat\{R\}\$, \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$ is a single statistic across all parameters that indicates lack of mixing, although individual variables' importance for this metric can also be determined. Additionally, \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$ is not based on any single characteristic of the sampling distribution; instead it uses all the information in the chain, including that given by the joint sampling distribution, which is currently largely overlooked by existing approaches. We recommend calculating \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$ using two different machine learning classifiers - gradient-boosted regression trees and random forests - which each work well in models of different dimensions. Because each of these methods outputs a classification probability, as a byproduct, we obtain uncertainty in \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$. The method is straightforward to implement and could be a complementary additional check on MCMC convergence for applied analyses.},

UGT2Bs are expressed in numerous human tissues, such as skin, breast, prostate, adipose, and intestine and are hypothesized to modulate steroid metabolism and excretion. Polymorphisms have been identified that may modify substrate specificities or enzyme activities of UGT2B family isozymes. We determined the prevalence of the UGT2B4(D458E), UGT2B7(H268Y), and UGT2B15(D85Y) polymorphisms in a sample of 233 individuals. The allele frequencies were significantly different (P {$<$} 0.02) between individuals of Caucasian and Asian descent for all three polymorphisms. In Asians (n = 32), the frequencies of the UGT2B4(D458), UGT2B7(H268), and UGT2B15(D85) alleles were 1.00, 0.73, and 0.64, respectively, whereas, in Caucasians (n = 202), the frequencies of UGT2B4(D458), UGT2B7(H268), and UGT2B15(D85) were 0.75, 0.46, and 0.45, respectively. The distribution of the UGT2B4(D458E), UGT2B7(H268Y), and UGT2B15(D85Y) genotypes also differed by ethnic group (P {$<$} 0.0001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.02, respectively). All Asians were homozygous for UGT2B4(D458) and had a greater than 2-fold higher prevalence of the UGT2B7(H268) and UGT2B15(D85) homozygous genotypes compared with Caucasians: 56.2\% versus 21.8\%, and 46.9\% versus 22.3\%, respectively. Concomitantly, only 9.4\% of Asians were UGT2B7(Y268) homozygous and 18.7\% were UGT2B15(Y85) homozygous compared with 29.2\% and 32.2\%, respectively, of Caucasians. The data suggest that there may be large differences in UGT2B polymorphisms between Asians and Caucasians. This warrants evaluation both in larger, multiethnic cohorts and in relation to known ecological differences in risk of sex hormone-dependent cancers.},

  abstract = {Poor tumor penetration is the most significant barrier to the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Despite numerous studies, little is known about how the physicochemical properties and tumor-associated environments impact liposome intratumoral penetration from a multi-factorial perspective. Thus, we developed a set of model liposomes to explore the laws of their intratumoral penetration. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that zeta potential, membrane fluidity, and size of liposomes could influence their penetration in the peripheral, intermediate, or central areas of the tumor, respectively. Moreover, protein corona and stromal cells primarily impeded liposome penetration in the tumor periphery, while the vascular vessels had a similar effect in the tumor center. Our results also revealed a non-monotonic relationship, indicating that the best condition for a single factor may not necessarily be the optimal choice when considering all the factors. The preferred size, zeta potential, and membrane fluidity for excellent tumor penetration are within the ranges of 52--72~nm, 16--24~mV, and 230--320 mp, respectively.

Over the past two decades, models have evolved to describe the temporal dynamics of biomarkers and tumor size, treatment-related adverse events, and their links to survival. Integrated models, defined here as models that incorporate at least two pharmacodynamic/ outcome variables, are applied to answer drug development questions through simulations, e.g., to support the exploration of alternative dosing strategies and study designs in subgroups of patients or other tumor indications. It is expected that these pharmacometric approaches will be expanded as regulatory authorities place further emphasis on early and individualized dosage optimization and inclusive patient-focused development strategies. This review provides an overview of integrated models in the literature, examples of the considerations that need to be made when applying these advanced pharmacometric approaches, and an outlook on the expected further expansion of model-informed drug development of anticancer drugs.},

Ten young and 10 elderly healthy subjects participated in this placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-phase crossover study. Subjects took clarithromycin 500 mg or placebo twice daily for 5 days. On day 4, subjects ingested an oral dose of 10 mg oxycodone. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites were measured for 48 hours, and pharmacological response for 12 hours. Clarithromycin decreased the apparent clearance of oxycodone by 53\% in young and 48\% in elderly subjects (P {$<$} 0.001) and prolonged its elimination half-life. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-{$\infty$}) of oxycodone was increased by 2.0-fold (range, 1.3-fold to 2.7-fold) (P {$<$} 0.001) in young and 2.3-fold (range, 1.1-fold to 3.8-fold) (P {$<$} 0.001) in elderly subjects. The formation of noroxycodone was decreased by 74\% in young and 71\% in elderly subjects (P {$<$} 0.001). The ratio of AUC0-{$\infty$} of oxycodone during the clarithromycin phase compared with the one with placebo did not differ between the age groups. Clarithromycin did not alter the pharmacological response to oxycodone. Clarithromycin increased the exposure to oral oxycodone, but the magnitude of this effect was not age related. Although the pharmacological response to oxycodone was not significantly influenced by clarithromycin, dose reductions may be necessary in the most sensitive patients to avoid adverse effects when oxycodone is used concomitantly with clarithromycin.},

Liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and ganglioside GM1 were prepared in the various size range. Optimal circulation activity (55\% injected dose at 4 h post injection) of GM1-containing liposomes, which correlated with a relatively high uptake of liposomes by EMT6 tumor in mouse, was obtained with a size range of 70 to 200 nm in diameter. Increasing the diameter of liposome to greater than 200 nm resulted in an enhancement of the spleen uptake and decrease of the blood level. For liposomes with a diameter of less than 70 nm, 70\% of the injected dose were taken up by the liver, presumably by the parenchymal cells. In contrast, the biodistribution of phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes was relatively insensitive to changes in liposome size; most of the injected dose was found in the liver. The effect of RES blockade on the circulation time of large (d {$>$} 300nm), GM1-containing liposomes was also studied. Dextran sulfate 500, a commonly used blockade reagent for Kupffer cells, bad no effect. On the other hand, preinjection of a large dose of liposomes with a diameter greater than 500 nm showed variable results depending on the lipid composition of the blocking liposomes. Preinjection of liposomes containing GM1, phosphatidylinositol or (N-polycthyleneglycol) phosphatidylethanolamine effectively reduced the spleen uptake of the large GM1-containing liposomes, whereas liposomes containing phosphatidic acid showed no effect. These results indicate that only spleen homing liposomes can be used as a blocking reagent to prolong the circulation time of the large GM1-containing liposomes.},

The phenomenon now known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for lipid and macromolecular agents has been observed to be universal in solid tumors. Primarily, enhanced vascular permeability will sustain an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen for rapid tumor growth. The EPR effect also provides a great opportunity for more selective targeting of lipid- or polymer-conjugated anticancer drugs, such as SMANCS and PK-1, to the tumor. In the present review, the basic characteristics of the EPR effect, particularly the factors involved, are described, as well as its modulation for improving delivery of macromolecular drugs to the tumor. Tumor-specific vascular physiology is also described.},

Current Bayesian forecasting tools typically rely only on the most probable model parameters (maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate). This MAP-based approach, however, does neither necessarily predict the most probable outcome nor does it quantify the risks of treatment inefficacy or toxicity. Bayesian data assimilation (DA) methods overcome these limitations by providing a comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We compare DA methods with MAP-based approaches and show how probabilistic statements about key markers related to chemotherapy-induced neutropenia can be leveraged for more informative decision support in individualized chemotherapy. Sequential Bayesian DA proved to be most computationally efficient for handling interoccasion variability and integrating TDM data. For new digital monitoring devices enabling more frequent data collection, these features will be of critical importance to improve patient care decisions in various therapeutic areas.},

  abstract = {Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) is a quantitative dosing framework that combines prior knowledge on the drug-disease-patient system with patient data from therapeutic drug/ biomarker monitoring (TDM) to support individualized dosing in ongoing treatment. Structural models and prior parameter distributions used in MIPD approaches typically build on prior clinical trials that involve only a limited number of patients selected according to some exclusion/inclusion criteria. Compared to the prior clinical trial population, the patient population in clinical practice can be expected to also include altered behavior and/or increased interindividual variability, the extent of which, however, is typically unknown. Here, we address the question of how to adapt and refine models on the level of the model parameters to better reflect this real-world diversity. We propose an approach for continued learning across patients during MIPD using a sequential hierarchical Bayesian framework. The approach builds on two stages to separate the update of the individual patient parameters from updating the population parameters. Consequently, it enables continued learning across hospitals or study centers, because only summary patient data (on the level of model parameters) need to be shared, but no individual TDM data. We illustrate this continued learning approach with neutrophil-guided dosing of paclitaxel. The present study constitutes an important step toward building confidence in MIPD and eventually establishing MIPD increasingly in everyday therapeutic use.},

  abstract = {RESULTS Part 2 of the guidelines on responsible opioid prescribing provides the following recommendations for initiating and maintaining chronic opioid therapy of 90 days or longer. 1. A) Comprehensive assessment and documentation is recommended before initiating opioid therapy, including documentation of comprehensive history, general medical condition, psychosocial history, psychiatric status, and substance use history. ( EVIDENCE good) B) Despite limited evidence for reliability and accuracy, screening for opioid use is recommended, as it will identify opioid abusers and reduce opioid abuse. ( EVIDENCE limited) C) Prescription monitoring programs must be implemented, as they provide data on patterns of prescription usage, reduce prescription drug abuse or doctor shopping. ( EVIDENCE good to fair) D) Urine drug testing (UDT) must be implemented from initiation along with subsequent adherence monitoring to decrease prescription drug abuse or illicit drug use when patients are in chronic pain management therapy. ( EVIDENCE good) 2. A) Establish appropriate physical diagnosis and psychological diagnosis if available prior to initiating opioid therapy. ( EVIDENCE good) B) Caution must be exercised in ordering various imaging and other evaluations, interpretation and communication with the patient, to avoid increased fear, activity restriction, requests for increased opioids, and maladaptive behaviors. ( EVIDENCE good) C) Stratify patients into one of the 3 risk categories - low, medium, or high risk. D) A pain management consultation, may assist non-pain physicians, if high-dose opioid therapy is utilized. ( EVIDENCE fair) 3. Essential to establish medical necessity prior to initiation or maintenance of opioid therapy. ( EVIDENCE good) 4. Establish treatment goals of opioid therapy with regard to pain relief and improvement in function. ( EVIDENCE good) 5. A) Long-acting opioids in high doses are recommended only in specific circumstances with severe intractable pain that is not amenable to short-acting or moderate doses of long-acting opioids, as there is no significant difference between long-acting and short-acting opioids for their effectiveness or adverse effects. ( EVIDENCE fair) B) The relative and absolute contraindications to opioid use in chronic non-cancer pain must be evaluated including respiratory instability, acute psychiatric instability, uncontrolled suicide risk, active or history of alcohol or substance abuse, confirmed allergy to opioid agents, coadministration of drugs capable of inducing life-limiting drug interaction, concomitant use of benzodiazepines, active diversion of controlled substances, and concomitant use of heavy doses of central nervous system depressants. ( EVIDENCE fair to limited) 6. A robust agreement which is followed by all parties is essential in initiating and maintaining opioid therapy as such agreements reduce overuse, misuse, abuse, and diversion. ( EVIDENCE fair) 7. A) Once medical necessity is established, opioid therapy may be initiated with low doses and short-acting drugs with appropriate monitoring to provide effective relief and avoid side effects. ( EVIDENCE fair for short-term effectiveness, limited for long-term effectiveness) B) Up to 40 mg of morphine equivalent is considered as low dose, 41 to 90 mg of morphine equivalent as a moderate dose, and greater than 91 mg of morphine equivalence as high dose. ( EVIDENCE fair) C) In reference to long-acting opioids, titration must be carried out with caution and overdose and misuse must be avoided. ( EVIDENCE good) 8. A) Methadone is recommended for use in late stages after failure of other opioid therapy and only by clinicians with specific training in the risks and uses. ( EVIDENCE limited) B) Monitoring recommendation for methadone prescription is that an electrocardiogram should be obtained prior to initiation, at 30 days and yearly thereafter. ( EVIDENCE fair) 9. In order to reduce prescription drug abuse and doctor shopping, adherence monitoring by UDT and PMDPs provide evidence that is essential to the identification of those patients who are non-compliant or abusing prescription drugs or illicit drugs. ( EVIDENCE fair) 10. Constipation must be closely monitored and a bowel regimen be initiated as soon as deemed necessary. ( EVIDENCE good) 11. Chronic opioid therapy may be continued, with continuous adherence monitoring, in well-selected populations, in conjunction with or after failure of other modalities of treatments with improvement in physical and functional status and minimal adverse effects. ( EVIDENCE fair). DISCLAIMER The guidelines are based on the best available evidence and do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations.

The mapbayr package was developed to perform maximum {$<$}italic{$>$}a posteriori{$<$}/italic{$>$} Bayesian estimation (MAP-BE) in R from any population PK model coded in mrgsolve. The performances of mapbayr were assessed using two approaches. First, ``test'' models with different features were coded, for example, first-order and zero-order absorption, lag time, time-varying covariates, Michaelis--Menten elimination, combined and exponential residual error, parent drug and metabolite, and small or large inter-individual variability (IIV). A total of 4000 PK profiles (combining single/multiple dosing and rich/sparse sampling) were simulated from each test model, and MAP-BE of parameters was performed in both mapbayr and NONMEM. Second, a similar procedure was conducted with seven ``real'' previously published models to compare mapbayr and NONMEM on a PK outcome used in MIPD. For the test models, 98\% of mapbayr estimations were identical to those given by NONMEM. Some discordances could be observed when dose-related parameters were estimated or when models with large IIV were used. The exploration of objective function values suggested that mapbayr might outdo NONMEM in specific cases. For the real models, a concordance close to 100\% on PK outcomes was observed. The mapbayr package provides a reliable solution to perform MAP-BE of PK parameters in R. It also includes functions dedicated to data formatting and reporting and enables the creation of standalone Shiny web applications dedicated to MIPD, whatever the model or the clinical protocol and without additional software other than R. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: To promote model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) for vancomycin (VCM), we developed statements for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Methods: Ten clinical questions were selected. The committee conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis as well as clinical studies to establish recommendations for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-guided dosing. Results: AUC-guided dosing tended to more strongly decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) than trough-guided dosing, and a lower risk of treatment failure was demonstrated for higher AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratios (cut-off of 400). Higher AUCs (cut-off of 600 {$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}h/mL) significantly increased the risk of AKI. Although Bayesian estimation with two-point measurement was recommended, the trough concentration alone may be used in patients with mild infections in whom VCM was administered with q12h. To increase the concentration on days 1--2, the routine use of a loading dose is required. TDM on day 2 before steady state is reached should be considered to optimize the dose in patients with serious infections and a high risk of AKI. Conclusions: These VCM TDM guidelines provide recommendations based on MIPD to increase treatment response while preventing adverse effects.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: TLD-1 is a novel pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) formulation aiming to optimise the PLD efficacy-toxicity ratio. We aimed to characterise TLD-1's population pharmacokinetics using non-compartmental analysis and nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. METHODS: The PK of TLD-1 was analysed by performing a non-compartmental analysis of longitudinal doxorubicin plasma concentration measurements obtained from a clinical trial in 30 patients with advanced solid tumours across a 4.5-fold dose range. Furthermore, a joint parent-metabolite PK model of doxorubicinentrapped, doxorubicinfree, and metabolite doxorubicinol was developed. Interindividual and interoccasion variability around the typical PK parameters and potential covariates to explain parts of this variability were explored. RESULTS: Medians~ {\textpm} standard deviations of dose-normalised doxorubicinentrapped+free Cmax and AUC0-{$\infty$} were 0.342 {\textpm} 0.134~mg/L and 40.1 {\textpm} 18.9~mg{$\cdot$}h/L, respectively. The median half-life (95~h) was 23.5~h longer than the half-life of currently marketed PLD. The novel joint parent-metabolite model comprised a one-compartment model with linear release (doxorubicinentrapped), a two-compartment model with linear elimination (doxorubicinfree), and a one-compartment model with linear elimination for doxorubicinol. Body surface area on the volumes of distribution for free doxorubicin was the only significant covariate. CONCLUSION: The population PK of TLD-1, including its release and main metabolite, were successfully characterised using non-compartmental and compartmental analyses. Based on its long half-life, TLD-1 presents a promising candidate for further clinical development. The PK characteristics form the basis to investigate TLD-1 exposure-response (i.e., clinical efficacy) and exposure-toxicity relationships in the future. Once such relationships have been established, the developed population PK model can be further used in model-informed precision dosing strategies.

For each observation, we define the prediction discrepancy (pd) as the percentile of the observation in the whole marginal predictive distribution under H0. We propose to compute prediction discrepancies using Monte Carlo integration which does not require model approximation. If the model is valid, these pd should be uniformly distributed over [0, 1] which can be tested by a Kolmogorov--Smirnov test. In a simulation study based on a standard population pharmacokinetic model, we compare and show the interest of this criterion with respect to the one most frequently used to evaluate nonlinear mixed-effects models: standardized prediction errors (spe) which are evaluated using a first order approximation of the model. Trends in pd can also be evaluated via several plots to check for specific departures from the model},

However, significant predictors for DOX pharmacokinetics identified using PopPK models varied across studies. Thus, this review aims to summarize PopPK models of DOX and its metabolites (if any) as well as significant covariates influencing DOX (and its metabolites) pharmacokinetic variability. A systematic search from PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Science Direct, and SCOPUS databases identified 503 studies. Of these, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. DOX pharmacokinetics was described with two- or three-compartment models. Most studies found a significant increase in DOX clearance with an increase in body surface area from the median value of 1.8 m \textsuperscript{2} . Moreover, this review identified that while a 10-year increase in patient age resulted in a decrease in DOX clearance in adults and the elderly, younger children had lower DOX clearance compared to older children. Further, low DOX exposure was observed in pregnant women, and thus dosage adjustment is required. Concerning model applicability, predictive performance assessment of these published models should be performed before implementing such models in clinical practice. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

It is also the purpose to propose a limited sampling strategy (LSS) for the estimation of the time above the threshold (0.2 micromol.L(-1)). A total 82 patients with lymphoid malignancy were involved in the study. A pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effect model. The influence of demographic characteristics, biological factors, and concurrent administration were investigated. The final predictive performance was validated by bootstrap and cross-validation. Bayesian estimation was evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of HD-MTX was described by a two-compartment model. The pharmacokinetic parameters and the inter-individual variability were as follows: the clearance CL, 7.45 L.h(-1) (inter-individual variability 50.6\%), the volume of the central and peripheral compartment V(1), 25.9 L (22.5\%), V(2), 9.23 L (97.8\%), respectively, and the intercompartmental clearance Q, 0.333 L.h(-1) (70.4\%). The influence of serum creatinine on CL and weight on V(1) was retained in the final model. The protocol involved one sampling time at 44 h after the start of the infusion, allowing one to predict the time at which the MTX concentration reached the expected threshold (0.2 micromol.L(-1)). Serum creatinine and weight showed significant influence on methotrexate CL and V(1), respectively. Furthermore, a Bayesian estimation based on the covariates and 44 h sample was developed, allowing prediction of the individual methotrexate pharmacokinetic parameters and the time to 0.2 micromol.L(-1).},

MIPD moves beyond traditional therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) by integrating mathematical predictions of dosing and considering patient-specific factors (patient characteristics, drug measurements) as well as different sources of variability. For this purpose, rigorous model qualification is required for the application of MIPD in patients. This review delves into new methods in model selection and validation, also highlighting the role of machine learning in improving MIPD, the utilization of biosensors for real-time monitoring, as well as the potential of models integrating biomarkers for efficacy or toxicity for precision dosing. The clinical evidence of TDM and MIPD is discussed for various medical fields including infection medicine, oncology, transplant medicine, and inflammatory bowel diseases, thereby underscoring the role of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and specific biomarkers. Further research, particularly randomized clinical trials, is warranted to corroborate the value of MIPD in enhancing patient outcomes and advancing personalized medicine.},

The purpose of this study was to develop an adaptive rescue strategy based upon the early detection of patients with impaired MTX elimination. Methods and results: In this study, we propose a simple population-based Bayesian approach for predicting MTX plasma concentration from a limited number of samples, so as to adapt both duration and dosage of the rescue agent to be used next. Ten kinetic profiles obtained after 10 courses of MTX (1{$\cdot$}5 g/m2) in seven patients with inflammatory breast cancer were used to establish the population pharmacokinetic parameters (Cl, 8{$\cdot$}16 L/h; t1/2, 12{$\cdot$}7 h). This population was next involved in the Bayesian estimation of MTX individual pharmacokinetic parameters from only two blood samples (T24 and T36 h), thus allowing one to forecast the elimination of this drug by predicting MTX levels at 48 h. According to the MTX concentrations predicted during the elimination phase, folinic acid rescue was then prolonged in patients likely to be overexposed. Conclusion: The Bayesian estimation presented in this study was an easy and convenient method to efficiently detect patients with impaired MTX elimination in routine clinical practice. This information enabled the introduction of strategies for minimizing the risk of severe drug toxicity.},

Drugs used in treating systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma have mostly proven ineffective because of difficulties crossing the blood--brain barrier. The recognition of the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate was a substantial therapeutic breakthrough and further advances, such as the development of polychemotherapy regimens, have built on this. Whole-brain radiotherapy can consolidate response to chemotherapy, but the associated toxic effects of chemoradiation can be unacceptable. Other effective approaches include disruption of the blood--brain barrier and the use of high-dose chemotherapy. Recently, there have been attempts to optimise multi-drug chemotherapy regimens by focusing on improving survival and reducing toxic effects. A promising area of research is the incorporation of novel targeted drugs into standard treatment frameworks. In the future, greater cooperation between research groups should hopefully lead to further therapeutic advances.},

  abstract = {Cytochrome P-450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is involved in the metabolism of many therapeutic drugs even though the enzyme represents a small proportion of the total CYP content of human liver. In vivo phenotyping with probe drug substrates such as debrisoquine and dextromethorphan showed a clear separation between poor metabolizers (PM) and extensive metabolizers (EM). This polymorphism may affect susceptibility to environmental disease, as suggested by molecular epidemiologic studies that found an association between CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype and cancer risk; however, this association is not consistent. There are only a few examples of CYP2D6 involvement in toxicant mechanism of action, but this has not been extensively studied. Gene probe studies documented a number of genetic polymorphisms that underlie CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes. The EM group carries the wild-type (*1) or active (*2) variant alleles, while the PM group carries the *3, *4, *5, or *6 alleles, all of which code for a protein that has lower or null CYP2D6 activity. The current analysis characterizes (a) influence of genotype on phenotype based upon in vivo metabolism studies of probe drugs and (b) frequency of the major genotypes in different population groups is also characterized. These data were then incorporated into Monte Carlo modeling to simulate population distributions of CYP2D6 activity. This analysis reproduced the bimodal distributions commonly seen in phenotyping studies of Caucasians and found extensive population variability in enzyme activity, as indicated by the 9- to 56-fold difference between the PM modal median and the total population median CYP2D6 activity. This substantial degree of interindividual variability in CYP function indicates that assessments involving CYP2D6 substrates need to consider the full distribution of enzyme activity in refining estimates of internal dose in health assessments of xenobiotics.},

In the in vitro interaction studies, the effects of antifungal drugs on specific activities of cytochrome P450s (CYPs), including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, in human liver microsomes are compared to predict the possibility of drug interactions in vivo. Fluconazole, micafungin, and voriconazole have lower inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 activities than itraconazole and miconazole, and IC(50) and/or K(i) values against CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activities are the lowest for miconazole, followed by voriconazole and fluconazole. In in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, it is well known that itraconazole is a potent clinically important inhibitor of the clearance of CYP3A4 substrates, and fluconazole and voriconazole are reported to increase the blood or plasma concentrations of not only midazolam and cyclosporine (CYP3A4 substrates) but also of phenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate) and/or omeprazole (CYP2C19/CYP3A4 substrate). On the other hand, no inhibition of CYP activities except for CYP3A4 activity by micafungin is observed in vitro, and the blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus are not affected by coadministration of micafungin in vivo, suggesting that micafungin would not cause clinically significant interactions with drugs that are metabolized by CYPs via the inhibition of metabolism. Miconazole is a potent inhibitor of all CYPs investigated in vitro, although there are few detailed studies on the clinical significance of this except for CYP2C9. Therefore the differential effects of these antifungal drugs on CYP activities must be considered in the choice of antifungal drugs in patients receiving other drugs.},

  abstract = {Abstract--- High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) with leucovorin rescue is a component of therapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Since MTX toxicity is related to drug exposure, a monitoring of serum MTX concentrations at H24, H48, H72 and until the concentration is less than 0.2 {$\mu$}mol/L is commonly performed. However, a number of patients may reach concentrations of less than 0.2 {$\mu$}mol/L long before the next sampling is scheduled. The aim of our study was to develop a Bayesian method predicting the time at which MTX concentration reaches 0.2 {$\mu$}mol/L in order to decrease the number of samples drawn and to allow for a more rapid patient discharge. Methotrexate population parameters were estimated from a retrospective analysis of 60 infusions in 23 children and MTX concentrations were predicted from an independent set of 20 courses in 14 children with a Bayesian approach using either one (H48) or two (H24 and H48) samples. The following population parameters were obtained using a two-compartment model: CL = 3.51 L/h (inter-individual variability: 66\%), Vd = 8.67 L (58\%), k12 = 0.0044 h-1 (105\%), k21 = 0.039 h-1 (25\%). Clearance and Vd were found to increase with weight and age respectively. Both sampling schedules tested for the Bayesian estimation enabled accurate prediction of concentrations and provided satisfactory precision despite a small bias. When considering the ability to predict the time at which the threshold was reached, the one-sample (H48) schedule gave the best results. We conclude that a sampling schedule involving only one sample and Bayesian parameter estimation may be able to predict the delay necessary to reach 0.2 {$\mu$}mol/L in each individual.},

Positively charged liposomes were more toxic in vitro (chick heart cells) and in vivo (5-fold reduction in LD50 in mice) than neutral or negatively charged liposomes. Based on these findings, adriamycin was encapsulated in negatively charged liposomes (PG: PC: Chol--1:4:5), sequentially extruded through polycarbonate membranes (to 0.2 micrometer pore size) and purified by exhaustive dialysis. This preparation had a mean vesicle diameter of 0.24 micrometer and was stable in serum (24 hr drug retention of 85\%). As compared with free drug, liposome-encapsulated adriamycin was less toxic in vitro to chick heart cells. In mice, adriamycin displayed short- (4-14 day) and long- (45-70 day) term toxicity. Encapsulating adriamycin increased both short- (20-50 mg/kg) and long- (10-15 mg/kg to 25-30 mg/kg) term LD50 levels. As compared with free drug, administering encapsulated adriamycin in vivo reduced the incidence of cardiac histopathologic lesions at 20 and 40 mg/kg. Compared in vivo, plasma levels of liposome-encapsulated adriamycin were 2/3-fold higher than free drug up to 24 hr post drug administration. Cardiac uptake of adriamycin was reduced 2-fold (conc x time value for 48 h) following encapsulated drug administration. Encapsulating adriamycin in liposomes did not alter its therapeutic effect against L1210 leukemic cells in vivo.},

The mechanism of this cardiotoxicity has remained elusive. Our data suggest that this toxicity could involve doxorubicinol, the primary circulating metabolite of doxorubicin. Doxorubicinol was markedly more potent than doxorubicin at compromising both systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Similarly, doxorubicinol was much more potent than doxorubicin at inhibiting the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum [ATP phosphohydrolase (Ca2+-transporting), EC 3.6.1.38], the Na+/K+ pump of sarcolemma [ATP phosphohydrolase (Na+/K+-transporting), EC 3.6.1.37], and the F0F1 proton pump of mitochondria [ATP phosphohydrolase (H+-transporting, EC 3.6.1.34]. Our finding that this highly toxic metabolite was produced by cardiac tissue exposed to doxorubicin suggests that doxorubicinol could accumulate in the heart and contribute significantly to the chronic cumulative cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin therapy. Our observation that doxorubicin was more potent than doxorubicinol in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro suggests that the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is dissociable from its anticancer activity.},

The mean concentration observed at the end of the infusion was 1016{\textpm}143 {$\mu$}mol/l. The mean dose delivered was 13.2{\textpm}2 g/m2. The clearance was 49.1{\textpm}11.7 ml min-1 m-2. The decay of the plasma concentration of MTX after completion of the infusion followed a two-compartment model with at1/2{$\alpha$} of 2.66{\textpm}0.82 h and at1/2{$\beta$} of 15.69{\textpm}8.63 h. The volume of distribution was 0.32{\textpm}0.08 l/kg. As compared with previously published data, the interindividual and intraindividual variations in the concentration at the end of the infusion were reduced, with values of 14\% and 5.9\%--21\%, respectively, being obtained. Severe toxicities were avoided, and there were only 3 hematologic and 8 digestive grade 3 side effects and no grade 4 complication. Thet1/2{$\alpha$} and the MTX plasma concentrations at 23 and 47 h were correlated with renal toxicity (P{$<$}0.001). However, no correlation was found between the pharmacokinetic parameters and other signs of toxicity. There was no significant difference in pharmacokinetics between the toxic and nontoxic groups. In the same manner, the parameters of the group of patients sensitive to MTX were not statistically significantly different from those of the group of nonsensitive patients.},

  abstract = {The clinical efficacy of the PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes (PLD) is limited by low tumor accumulation and limited intra-tumoral disposition. Decoration with the cell penetration enhancers (CPEs) can increase the PLD permeability via the biological barriers, however at the expense of enhanced distribution to the non-target organs and tissues, and may interfere with their tumor accumulation and with the resulting anti-cancer effects. We investigated the effect of the surface CPE agent tetraArg-[G-1]-distearoyl glycerol (DAG-Arg4) on the systemic and intra-tumoral accumulation of PLD, using a 4~T1-Luc murine orthotopic model of breast cancer, using several analytical approaches. CPE-decorated liposomes undergo efficient in vitro endocytosis, and delivered doxorubicin to the cell nuclei. In vivo, they had lower tumor and spleen accumulation, similar liver accumulation, and higher lung accumulation, as compared to those of the PLD. Despite the lower tumor accumulation, CPE-decorated liposomes induced more prominent in vivo anti-cancer effects, as compared to the PLD, apparently ascribable to the higher intra-tumoral permeability mediated by the CPE surface residues. Overall, liposomes decoration with the CPE residues had mostly beneficial effects on their systemic and intra-tumoral disposition. The mechanisms of the CPE-mediated effects on the liposome disposition should be further assessed with additional experimental models using robust analytical methods with high spatial resolution.},

A double-blind randomized pretreatment with amitriptyline (10-50 mg a day) or placebo was given prior to oral oxycodone. 2. The concentrations of oxycodone, noroxycodone and oxymorphone in plasma and the 24 h urine recoveries of their conjugated and unconjugated forms were measured by gas chromatography. 3. No differences were found between treatments in mean Cmax and AUC values of oxycodone which varied from 34 to 38 ng ml-1 and from 208 to 245 ng ml-1 h, respectively. The median tmax of oxycodone was 1 h in all groups. The bioavailability of oral relative to i.m. oxycodone was 60\%. The mean renal clearance of oxycodone was 0.07-0.08 l min-1. The kinetics of oxycodone were unaffected by amitriptyline. 4. The mean ratio of the AUC(0.24 h) values of unconjugated noroxycodone to oxycodone was 0.45 after i.m. oxycodone and 0.6-0.8 after oral oxycodone. Plasma oxymorphone concentrations were below the limit of the assay. Eight to 14\% of the dose of oxycodone was excreted in the urine as unconjugated and conjugated oxycodone over 24 h. Oxymorphone was excreted mainly as a conjugate whereas noroxycodone was recovered mostly in an unconjugated form.},

This article introduces the concept of synthetic datasets, which is an emerging method originally developed to permit the sharing of confidential census data. Synthetic datasets mimic real datasets by preserving their statistical properties and the relationships between variables. Importantly, this method also reduces disclosure risk to essentially nil as no record in the synthetic dataset represents a real individual. This practical guide with accompanying R script enables biobehavioural researchers to create synthetic datasets and assess their utility via the {$<$}italic{$>$}synthpop{$<$}/italic{$>$} R package.

  abstract = {The anthracyclines are a group of antibiotics that are among the most potent chemotherapeutic agents. They are highly effective against a broad spectrum of malignancies, including lymphoma, gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer, sarcoma, and breast cancer. Unfortunately, these agents also exhibit a well-recognized cumulative-dose related cardiotoxic profile that limits the extent to which they can be used safely. In clinical practice, most clinicians limit the cumulative dose of doxorubicin (the most widely used agent in this group) to 400-450 mg/m2, but considerable cardiac damage is now known to occur at cumulative dosages considerably below this level. Regimens using newer combinations of agents, the most widely studied of which is the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, are known to augment the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. The application of nanotechnology to medicine involves the use of devices that will interact with the body at the molecular level. These methods can lead to target and tissue specific clinical application, often with minimal or reduced side effects. Liposomal preparations incorporate such technology, thereby altering some important characteristics of the parent compound and facilitating concentration at the tumor site. In the case of liposomal doxorubicin, cardiotoxicity is reduced significantly. This review summarizes the important information on the liposomal preparation of anthracyclines.},

Glucarpidase is a treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for high methotrexate concentrations in the context of kidney dysfunction, but the guidelines for when to use it are unclear. An expert panel was convened to provide specific, expert consensus guidelines for the use of glucarpidase in patients who develop HDMTX-induced nephrotoxicity and delayed methotrexate excretion. The guideline provides recommendations to identify the population of patients who would benefit from glucarpidase rescue by more precisely defining the absolute methotrexate concentrations associated with risk for severe or life-threatening toxicity at several time points after the start of an HDMTX infusion. For an HDMTX infusion {$\leq$}24 hours, if the 36-hour concentration is above 30 {\textmu}M, 42-hour concentration is above 10 {\textmu}M, or 48-hour concentration is above 5 {\textmu}M and the serum creatinine is significantly elevated relative to the baseline measurement (indicative of HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury), glucarpidase may be indicated. After a 36- to 42-hour HDMTX infusion, glucarpidase may be indicated when the 48-hour methotrexate concentration is above 5 {\textmu}M. Administration of glucarpidase should optimally occur within 48-60 hours from the start of the HDMTX infusion, because life-threatening toxicities may not be preventable beyond this time point. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Glucarpidase is a rarely used medication that is less effective when given after more than 60 hours of exposure to high-dose methotrexate, so predicting early which patients will need it is imperative. There are no currently available consensus guidelines for the use of this medication. The indication on the label does not give specific methotrexate concentrations above which it should be used. An international group of experts was convened to develop a consensus guideline that was specific and evidence-based to identify the population of patients who would benefit from glucarpidase.},

The N-demethylation by CYP3A4/5 and the O-demethylation by CYP2D6 in human liver microsomes (HLM) followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with intrinsic clearances of 1.46{$\mu$}L/min/mg and 0.35{$\mu$}L/min/mg, respectively. Although noroxycodone and oxymorphone mainly contribute to the elimination of oxycodone, the simulated total in vivo clearance using in vitro phase I metabolism was underestimated. For the first time, metabolism of oxycodone by UGT was deeply investigated using HLM, recombinant enzymes and selective inhibitors. Oxycodone-glucuronide was mainly produced by UGT2B7 (Km=762{\textpm}153{$\mu$}M, Vmax=344{\textpm}20 peak area/min/mg) and to a lesser extent by UGT2B4 (Km=2454{\textpm}497{$\mu$}M, Vmax=201{\textpm}19 peak area/min/mg). Finally, the kinetics of the drug-drug interactions were assessed using two CYP and UGT cocktail approaches. Incubations of HLM with phase I and phase II drug probes showed that oxycodone mainly decreased the in vitro activities of CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A3, UGT1A6 and UGT2B subfamily with an important impact on UGT2B7.},

  abstract = {Background Vedolizumab, an anti-{$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}7 integrin monoclonal antibody (mAb), is indicated for treating patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). As higher therapeutic mAb concentrations have been associated with greater efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease, understanding determinants of vedolizumab clearance may help to optimise dosing. Aims To characterise vedolizumab pharmacokinetics in patients with UC and CD, to identify clinically relevant determinants of vedolizumab clearance, and to describe the pharmacokinetic--pharmacodynamic relationship using population modelling. Methods Data from a phase 1 healthy volunteer study, a phase 2 UC study, and 3 phase 3 UC/CD studies were included. Population pharmacokinetic analysis for repeated measures was conducted using nonlinear mixed effects modelling. Results from the base model, developed using extensive phase 1 and 2 data, were used to develop the full covariate model, which was fit to sparse phase 3 data. Results Vedolizumab pharmacokinetics was described by a 2-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination. Using reference covariate values, linear elimination half-life of vedolizumab was 25.5 days; linear clearance (CLL) was 0.159 L/day for UC and 0.155 L/day for CD; central compartment volume of distribution (Vc) was 3.19 L; and peripheral compartment volume of distribution was 1.66 L. Interindividual variabilities (\%CV) were 35\% for CLL and 19\% for Vc; residual variance was 24\%. Only extreme albumin and body weight values were identified as potential clinically important predictors of CLL. Conclusions Population pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD. This analysis supports use of vedolizumab fixed dosing in these patients.

Herein, we review the principles behind targeted delivery approaches to determine potential reasons for their limited clinical translation and success. We propose criteria and considerations that must be taken into account for the development of novel actively targeted NCs. We also highlight the possible directions for the development of successful tumor targeting strategies.},

The pharmacokinetics of methotrexate, determined by fluorescence polarization immuno-assay, was successively described by a 2- and a 3-compartment open model with elimination from the central compartment. Population pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by non-linear regression from 8 data points for each course and were subsequently used to fit the same data by the Bayesian estimation method. According to Akaike's information criterion, the 3-compartment model was found statistically superior in 7 patients out of 10. Using this model clearance was well predicted (+/- 5\%) by the Bayesian method with only 2 points taken at the end of the infusion and 24 h after. The prediction was less good for the steady-state volume of distribution (+/- 18\%) and the half-lives (+/- 20-30\%). This procedure enables a good estimation of individual pharmacokinetic parameters for methotrexate, specially with clearance, at minimal cost and minimal disturbance for the patient.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE There is high interindividual variability in the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes catalysing the oxidation of oxycodone [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A], due to genetic polymorphisms and/or drug-drug interactions. The effects of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A activity modulation on the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone remains poorly explored. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH A randomized crossover double-blind placebo-controlled study was performed with 10 healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2D6 [six extensive (EM), two deficient (PM/IM) and two ultrarapid metabolizers (UM)]. The volunteers randomly received on five different occasions: oxycodone 0.2 mg x kg(-1) and placebo; oxycodone and quinidine (CYP2D6 inhibitor); oxycodone and ketoconazole (CYP3A inhibitor); oxycodone and quinidine+ketoconazole; placebo. Blood samples for plasma concentrations of oxycodone and metabolites (oxymorphone, noroxycodone and noroxymorphone) were collected for 24 h after dosing. Phenotyping for CYP2D6 (with dextromethorphan) and CYP3A (with midazolam) were assessed at each session. KEY RESULTS CYP2D6 activity was correlated with oxymorphone and noroxymorphone AUCs and C(max) (-0.71 {$<$} Spearman correlation coefficient rhos {$<$} -0.92). Oxymorphone C(max) was 62\% and 75\% lower in PM than EM and UM. Noroxymorphone C(max) reduction was even more pronounced (90\%). In UM, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone concentrations increased whereas noroxycodone exposure was halved. Blocking CYP2D6 (with quinidine) reduced oxymorphone and noroxymorphone C(max) by 40\% and 80\%, and increased noroxycodone AUC(infinity) by 70\%. Blocking CYP3A4 (with ketoconazole) tripled oxymorphone AUC(infinity) and reduced noroxycodone and noroxymorphone AUCs by 80\%. Shunting to CYP2D6 pathway was observed after CYP3A4 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Drug-drug interactions via CYP2D6 and CYP3A affected oxycodone pharmacokinetics and its magnitude depended on CYP2D6 genotype.},

However, high variability in infliximab trough levels has been associated with diverse response rates. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) with population pharmacokinetic models could help to individualize infliximab dosing regimens and improve therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive performance of published infliximab population pharmacokinetic models for IBD patients with an external data set. The data set consisted of 105 IBD patients with 336 infliximab concentrations. Literature review identified 12 published models eligible for external evaluation. Model performance was evaluated with goodness-of-fit plots, prediction- and variability-corrected visual predictive checks (pvcVPCs) and quantitative measures. For anti-drug antibody (ADA)-negative patients, model accuracy decreased for predictions \&gt; 6 months, while bias did not increase. In general, predictions for patients developing ADA were less accurate for all models investigated. Two models with the highest classification accuracy identified necessary dose escalations (for trough concentrations \&lt; 5 {\textmu}g/mL) in 88\% of cases. In summary, population pharmacokinetic modeling can be used to individualize infliximab dosing and thereby help to prevent infliximab trough concentrations dropping below the target trough concentration. However, predictions of infliximab concentrations for patients developing ADA remain challenging.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {HDMTX is a well-established regimen used in a variety of neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoma (NHL). Risk factors contributing to a delayed MTX-elimination and toxicity have been studied in pediatric pts with HDMTX (Relling MV, J Clin Oncol 1994, 12: 1667--72). However, data are scarce on risk factors contributing to delayed MTX elimination in adult pts, on toxicities in elderly pts and from pts treated with HDMTX outside clinical trials. We assessed toxicities and risk factors in all non-pediatric pts treated with HDMTX at the Charit{\'e} in 2003/04. 141 pts (age 16--81y, median 44y) received 614 HDMTX cycles (median dose MTX/m2: 3000mg, range 320--12000mg) for ALL (39), NHL (38), CNS-NHL (36), sarcoma or other solid tumor (28) within (69) or outside (72) clinical trials. In 99/614 (16\%) of HDMTX cycles a 15--85\% (median 50\%) dose reduction was carried out due to renal dysfunction (58), severe toxicity of prior chemotherapy (18) or other reasons (23). Toxicities in 62/614 (10\%) HDMTX cycles caused delays of 1--50 days (median 7 days) of scheduled therapy. 61/614 (10\%) HDMTX cycles resulted in an increase of serum creatinine values above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (median of 112{$\mu$}mol/L, range 81--386{$\mu$}mol/L). Delayed MTX-elimination (MTX blood level {$>$}150{$\mu$}M 24h, {$>$}3{$\mu$}M 36h, {$>$}1{$\mu$}M 42h, {$>$}0.4{$\mu$}M 48h or {$>$}0.1{$\mu$}M 68h) occurred in 156/614 (25\%) HDMTX cycles. Grade 3/4 toxicities were recorded in 224 (36\%) cycles for leukopenia, 127 (21\%) cycles for liver toxicity, 116 (19\%) cycles for thrombocytopenia, 88 (14\%) cycles for fever with neutropenia and 63 (10\%) cycles for mucositis/gastrointestinal toxicity. Presence of a 3rd space and comedications with known interference with MTX elimination or nephrotoxic potential were associated with a delayed MTX elimination (p{$<$}0.01). Overweight (BMI{$\geq$}25kg/m2), urine pH{$<$}7 at some time after HDMTX and presence of a 3rd space were associated with an increase of serum creatinine values above ULN (p{$\leq$}0.05). Pts with delayed MTX elimination or an increase of serum creatinine above ULN were older compared to pts with regular MTX elimination (median age 51y vs. 30y and 54y vs. 35y, p{$<$}0.01). Pts receiving HDMTX outside clinical trials more frequently experienced delayed MTX elimination (p{$<$}0.01). HDMTX frequently causes grade 3/4 hematotoxicity and increases of serum creatinine. Delayed MTX elimination is associated with advanced age and therapy outside clinical trials. Improved supportive care strategies are needed, especially in pts with advanced age, to ensure predictable MTX-elimination and reduce toxicities associated with HDMTX.},

  abstract = {Often drug dosage may be chosen rationally by use of plasma concentration (CP) as the ``therapeutic'' end point. The ability to accurately forecast the CP resulting from a dosage regimen is central to choosing that regimen. Traditionally forecasting has been attempted only by accounting for known influences on pharmacokinetics, such as sex, age, and renal disease. One must also adjust for previously observed CPs. Herein, we discuss and explain an approach to both of these tasks, mainly focusing on the latter. The approach balances observed outcomes against prior expectations taking account of observation CP error. For digoxin, use of 1 measured CP, as opposed to none, improves forecast precision for future CPs by 40\% (decrement in variance of forecast error), and 2 CPs improve it by 67\%. There is also an increase in forecast accuracy (decrement in mean of forecast error) as the number of CPs used increases. After only 2, forecast accuracy and precision are as good as theoretically possible. Moreover, information from CPs is far more valuable for forecasting than that from observable patient features---sex, age, and the like; use of all the latter information does not improve accuracy and precision as much as only 1 CP.},

  abstract = {One of the objectives of Pharmacometry (PMX) population modeling is the identification of significant and clinically relevant relationships between parameters and covariates. Here, we demonstrate how this complex selection task could benefit from supervised learning algorithms using importance scores. We compare various classical methods with three machine learning (ML) methods applied to NONMEM empirical Bayes estimates: random forest, neural networks (NNs), and support vector regression (SVR). The performance of the ML models is assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The F1 score, which measures test accuracy, is used to compare ML and PMX approaches. Methods are applied to different scenarios of covariate influence based on simulated pharmacokinetics data. ML achieved similar or better F1 scores than stepwise covariate modeling (SCM) and conditional sampling for stepwise approach based on correlation tests (COSSAC). Correlations between covariates and the number of false covariates does not affect the performance of any method, but effect size has an impact. Methods are not equivalent with respect to computational speed; SCM is 30 and 100-times slower than NN and SVR, respectively. The results are validated in an additional scenario involving 100 covariates. Taken together, the results indicate that ML methods can greatly increase the efficiency of population covariate model building in the case of large datasets or complex models that require long run-times. This can provide fast initial covariate screening, which can be followed by more conventional PMX approaches to assess the clinical relevance of selected covariates and build the final model.},

While this qualitative relationship has been well established, the quantitative and mechanistic aspects of H2O2 signaling are still being elucidated.

We sought to improve our dynamic and mechanistic understanding of the mitochondrial H2O2 reaction network in HeLa cells by creating a kinetic model of this system and using it to explore basal and perturbed conditions. The model uses the most current quantitative proteomic and kinetic data available to predict reaction rates and steady-state concentrations of H2O2 and its reaction partners within individual mitochondria. Time scales ranging from milliseconds to one hour were simulated. We predict that basal, steady-state mitochondrial H2O2 will be in the low nM range (2-4 nM) and will be inversely dependent on the total pool of peroxiredoxin-3 (Prx3). Neglecting efflux of H2O2 to the cytosol, the mitochondrial reaction network is expected to control perturbations well up to H2O2 generation rates {\textasciitilde}50 {$\mu$}M/s (0.25 nmol/mg-protein/s), above which point the Prx3 system would be expected to collapse. Comparison of these results with redox Western blots of Prx3 and Prx2 oxidation states demonstrated reasonable trend agreement at short times ({$\leq$} 15 min) for a range of experimentally perturbed H2O2 generation rates. At longer times, substantial efflux of H2O2 from the mitochondria to the cytosol was evidenced by peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) oxidation, and Prx3 collapse was not observed. A refined model using Monte Carlo parameter sampling was used to explore rates of H2O2 efflux that could reconcile model predictions of Prx3 oxidation states with the experimental observations.},

After 375 infusions, 48-hour methotrexate levels fell within 2 standard deviations of the mean for nontoxic infusions, and myelosuppression did not occur. Methotrexate concentrations exceeded the range for nontoxic patients (mean {\textpm}2 standard deviations) after 20 infusions. Serious myelosuppression occurred after six of these 20 infusions, including five of 12 infusions associated with 48-hour drug concentrations above 9 X 10--7 M. In seven patients with 48-hour concentrations above 9 X 10--7 M, the absence of toxicity could be attributed to subsequent rapid clearance of the drug; four of these patients also received large doses of supplemental leucovorin (50 to 100 mg per square meter every six hours). Determination of methotrexate concentration in plasma thus identified patients at high risk of toxicity, a group that may benefit from supplemental leucovorin rescue. (N Engl J Med 297:630--634, 1977) Methotraexate, an effective agent in treatment of leukemia, choriocarcinoma and other tumors, is one of the most versatile antineoplastic agents because its toxicity in high-dose regimens can be prevented by the reduced folate, leucovorin (5-formyltetrahydrofolate).1 High-dose methotrexate regimens (50 mg per kilogram or more) with leucovorin rescue have produced responses in metastatic osteogenic sarcoma2 and other tumors3 and have lengthened the relapse-free interval when used as an adjuvant after surgical excision of nonmetastatic osteogenic sarcoma.4 High-dose methotrexate therapy has not been without serious complications.

The stepwise covariate model (SCM) building procedure is the most common method for covariate model development. Despite its advantages, the traditional SCM method is known to have long runtimes and the suboptimal ability to select relevant covariates, especially in more complex phase III settings. In this work, two alternative approaches are presented: SCM+, which introduces the ``adaptive scope reduction'' and changes to general estimation settings, and ``stage-wise filtering,'' which groups covariates into categories based on their importance (mechanistic, structural, and exploratory). The three methods (SCM, SCM+, and SCM+ with stage-wise filtering) are applied to data from a simulated phase III population pharmacokinetic study and are compared in terms of efficiency and relevance. The two SCM+ methods were considerably more efficient than the traditional SCM: the number of function evaluations was reduced by 70\% for SCM+ and by 76\% for SCM+ with stage-wise filtering compared to SCM; the corresponding number of executed models was reduced by 44\% for SCM+ and 70\% for SCM+ with stage-wise filtering. In addition, among the three methods, SCM+ with stage-wise filtering selected the highest number of relevant covariates. Given the improved efficiency and ability to select relevant covariates shown in this work, the use of SCM+ and stage-wise filtering can greatly increase the efficiency of covariate modeling in drug development, which will ultimately facilitate more timely support for decision making.},

A large-scale study that retrospectively evaluated the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin reported that an estimated 7\% of patients developed doxorubicin-related congestive heart failure (CHF) after a cumulative dose of 550 mg/m                 2                 . To assess whether this estimate is reflective of the incidence in the broader clinical oncology setting, the authors evaluated data from three prospective studies to determine both the incidence of doxorubicin-related CHF and the accumulated dose of doxorubicin at which CHF occurs.                                                        METHODS               A group of 630 patients who were randomized to a doxorubicin-plus-placebo arm of three Phase III studies, two studies in patients with breast carcinoma and one study in patients with small cell lung carcinoma, were included in the analysis.                                         RESULTS                                Thirty-two of 630 patients had a diagnosis of CHF. Analysis indicated that an estimated cumulative 26\% of patients would experience doxorubicin-related CHF at a cumulative dose of 550 mg/m                 2                 . Age appeared to be an important risk factor for doxorubicin-related CHF after a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m                 2                 , with older patients (age {$>$} 65 years) showing a greater incidence of CHF compared with younger patients (age {$\leq$} 65 years). In addition, {$>$} 50\% of the patients who experienced doxorubicin-related CHF had a reduction {$<$} 30\% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) while they were on study.                                                        CONCLUSIONS               Doxorubicin-related CHF occurs with greater frequency and at a lower cumulative dose than previously reported. These findings further indicate that LVEF is not an accurate predictor of CHF in patients who receive doxorubicin. Cancer 2003;97:2869--79. {\copyright} 2003 American Cancer Society.

The objective of this study was to determine whether stealth liposomal doxorubicin accumulates selectively in bone metastases based on clinical material obtained from two patients with breast carcinoma. METHODS: Tumor tissue was obtained from two women (ages 33 years and 41 years, respectively) with metastatic breast carcinoma who responded to treatment with stealth liposomal doxorubicin and later underwent a surgical fixation procedure to treat a pathologic fracture of the femur. Drug levels in the tumor and adjacent muscle were examined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis in both patients and by fluorescence microscopy in one of the patients. RESULTS: Bone tumor fragments obtained during surgery performed 6 days after the administration of the 12th course of stealth liposomal doxorubicin in 1 patient and 12 days after the administration of the 16th course of stealth liposomal doxorubicin in the second patient had a 10-fold greater concentration of liposomal doxorubicin than tumor free muscle. Doxorubicin fluorescence and specific nuclear staining showed good colocalization, thus confirming the presence of the liposome-delivered drug in the nuclei of tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Using skeletal muscle as a comparator, stealth liposomal doxorubicin accumulates selectively in metastatic breast carcinoma cells within bone.},

  abstract = {Clinical trial simulations make use of input/output models with covariate effects; the virtual patient population generated for the simulation should therefore display physiologically reasonable covariate distributions. Covariate distribution modeling is one method used to create sets of covariate values (vectors) that characterize individual virtual patients, which should be representative of real subjects participating in clinical trials. Covariates can be continuous (e.g., body weight, age) or categorical (e.g., sex, race). A modeling method commonly used for incorporating both continuous and categorical covariates, the Discrete method, requires the patient population to be divided into subgroups for each unique combination of categorical covariates, with separate multivariate functions for the continuous covariates in each subset. However, when there are multiple categorical covariates this approach can result in subgroups with very few representative patients, and thus, insufficient data to build a model that characterizes these patient groups. To resolve this limitation, an application of a statistical methodology (Continuous method) was conceived to enable sampling of complete covariate vectors, including both continuous and categorical covariates, from a single multivariate function. The Discrete and Continuous methods were compared using both simulated and real data with respect to their ability to generate virtual patient distributions that match a target population. The simulated data sets consisted of one categorical and two correlated continuous covariates. The proportion of patients in each subgroup, correlation between the continuous covariates, and ratio of the means of the continuous covariates in the subgroups were varied. During evaluation, both methods accurately generated the summary statistics and proper proportions of the target population. In general, the Continuous method performed as well as the Discrete method, except when the subgroups, defined by categorical value, had markedly different continuous covariate means, for which, in the authors' experience, there are few clinically relevant examples. The Continuous method allows analysis of the full population instead of multiple subgroups, reducing the number of analyses that must be performed, and thereby increasing efficiency. More importantly, analyzing a larger pool of data increases the precision of the covariance estimates of the covariates, thus improving the accuracy of the description of the covariate distribution in the simulated population.},

One limitation identified during the original development of the MTXPK.org tool was the perceived generalizability because the modeled population comprised solely of Nordic pediatric patients receiving 24-h infusions for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The goal of our study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of HDMTX from a diverse patient population (e.g., races, ethnicity, indications for methotrexate, and variable infusion durations) and identify meaningful factors that account for methotrexate variability and improve the model's performance. To do this, retrospectively analyzed pharmacokinetic and toxicity data from pediatric and adolescent young adult patients who were receiving HDMTX ({$>$}0.5\,g/m2) for the treatment of a cancer diagnosis from three pediatric medical centers. We performed population pharmacokinetic modeling referencing the original MTXPK.org NONMEM model (includes body surface area and serum creatinine as covariates) on 1668 patients, 7506 administrations of HDMTX, and 30,250 concentrations. Our results support the parameterizations of short infusion duration ({$<$}8\,h) and the presence of Down syndrome on methotrexate clearance, the parameterization of severe hypoalbuminemia ({$<$}2.5\,g/dL) on the intercompartmental clearance (Q2 and Q3), and the parameterization of pleural effusion on the volume of distribution (V1 and V2). These novel parameterizations will increase the generalizability of the MTXPK.org model once they are added to the webtool.},

  abstract = {Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate, is administered at high doses to treat malignancies in children and adults. However, there is considerable interpatient variability in clearance of high-dose (HD) MTX. Patients with delayed clearance are at an increased risk for severe nephrotoxicity and life-threatening systemic MTX exposure. Glucarpidase is a rescue agent for severe MTX toxicity that reduces plasma MTX levels via hydrolysis of MTX into inactive metabolites, but is only indicated when MTX concentrations are {$>$} 2 SDs above the mean excretion curve specific for the given dose together with a significant creatinine increase ({$>$} 50\%). Appropriate administration of glucarpidase is challenging due to the ambiguity in the labeled indication. A recent consensus guideline was published with an algorithm to provide clarity in when to administer glucarpidase, yet clinical interpretation of laboratory results that do not directly correspond to the algorithm prove to be a limitation of its use. The goal of our study was to develop a clinical decision support tool to optimize the administration of glucarpidase for patients receiving HD MTX. Here, we describe the development of a novel 3-compartment MTX population pharmacokinetic (PK) model using 31,672 MTX plasma concentrations from 772 pediatric patients receiving HD MTX for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its integration into the online clinical decision support tool, MTXPK.org. This web-based tool has the functionality to utilize individualized demographics, serum creatinine, and real-time drug concentrations to predict the elimination profile and facilitate model-informed administration of glucarpidase.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, the Taylor series or Taylor expansion of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor series are named after Brook Taylor, who introduced them in 1715. A Taylor series is also called a Maclaurin series when 0 is the point where the derivatives are considered, after Colin Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century. The partial sum formed by the first n + 1 terms of a Taylor series is a polynomial of degree n that is called the nth Taylor polynomial of the function. Taylor polynomials are approximations of a function, which become generally more accurate as n increases. Taylor's theorem gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such approximations. If the Taylor series of a function is convergent, its sum is the limit of the infinite sequence of the Taylor polynomials. A function may differ from the sum of its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series is convergent. A function is analytic at a point x if it is equal to the sum of its Taylor series in some open interval (or open disk in the complex plane) containing x. This implies that the function is analytic at every point of the interval (or disk).},

Using these individualized parameter estimates and simulated drug exposure, dosing recommendations can be generated to maximize target attainment to improve beneficial effect and minimize toxicity. However, the accuracy of the output from this evaluation is highly dependent on the population pharmacokinetic model selected. This tutorial provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating, selecting, and validating a model for input and implementation into a model-informed precision dosing program.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                                           Tobramycin dosing in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenged by its high pharmacokinetic (PK) variability and narrow therapeutic window. Doses are typically individualized using two-sample log-linear regression (LLR) to quantify the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Bayesian model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) may allow dose individualization with fewer samples; however, the relative performance of these methods is unknown. This single-center retrospective analysis included adult patients with CF receiving tobramycin from 2015 to 2022. Tobramycin concentrations were predicted using LLR or Bayesian estimation with two population PK models (Hennig and Alghanem). Then, both methods were used to estimate the AUC for simulated patients. For Bayesian estimation, AUC estimation with flattened priors and limited sampling strategies were also assessed. Predictions were evaluated using normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), mean percent error (MPE), and accuracy. The data set included 70 treatment courses, with 32 not evaluable by LLR due to detection limits or timing issues. Bayesian estimation demonstrated worse accuracy (47.1\%--50.7\% vs 75.7\%), higher MPE (24.2\%--32.4\% vs -2.4\%), and higher nRMSE (35.0\%--39.4\% vs 24.8\%) than LLR for peak concentrations but performed better on troughs (accuracy: 92.0\%--92.9\% vs 84.6\%). Bayesian estimation with flattened priors and a single sample at 4 h was comparable to LLR performance, with better accuracy (42.9\%--68.0\% vs 41.1\% LLR), comparable MPE (-2.3\% to -3.7\% vs -0.5\%) and nRMSE (11.3\%--21.6\% vs 17.3\%). Bayesian estimation with one concentration and flattened priors can match LLR prediction accuracy. However, popPK models must be improved to better estimate peak samples.},

  abstract = {In cancer chemotherapy, routine monitoring of drug concentrations has been practical only for methotrexate (MTX). The primary setting for pharmacokinetic monitoring of MTX is its use in high doses (HDMTX) for adjuvant therapy of osteosarcoma, for single-agent treatment of intracranial lymphomas, and in combination therapy of childhood leukemia as well as adult and pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Typically, HDMTX is infused in doses of 3-15 g/m2 over a period of 6-24 h. Precautions must be taken to ensure a high urine flow and an alkaline urine pH, so as to prevent precipitation of MTX in urine. Patients with decreased renal function, advanced in age, and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or nephrotoxic agents are at increased risk of developing renal dysfunction during MTX infusion, thus being placed at high risk for toxicity. At the end of HDMTX infusion, and periodically thereafter for 24-48 h, drug concentrations are measured to assure that the disappearance rate of MTX from plasma is occurring at a normal rate. Also, at the end of HDMTX infusion, the patient is given leucovorin (5-formyl-tetrahydrofolic acid; LV), which replenishes intracellular stores of reduced folate and attenuates the toxicity secondary to HDMTX. In the presence of inappropriately high concentrations of MTX, routine doses of LV will be ineffective; the dose of LV required must be increased in proportion to the MTX concentration it faces in plasma. In practice, routine monitoring of plasma MTX concentrations allows early detection of abnormal clearance, as well as institution of early and effective countermeasures, including the use of increased and prolonged LV rescue.},

DXR, lip- DXR, and lip+ DXR were administered i.v. (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) at Day 17 for 5 consecutive days and then weekly. Control animals showed progressive tumor growth leading to death 27 days after inoculation. Antitumor activity for all three preparations was dose dependent. DXR and lip- DXR showed the same antitumor activity; lip+ DXR had less antitumor activity. The overall survival of tumor-bearing animals treated with 2.0-mg/kg lip- DXR was significantly prolonged (p less than 0.05) in comparison to the animals treated with 2.0-mg/kg free DXR. Grade III cardiomyopathy was observed 47 days after treatment with free DXR; treatment with lip- DXR resulted in Grade I cardiomyopathy. In animals treated with 1.0-mg/kg and 2.0-mg/kg free DXR urinary albumin concentrations of 10 g/liter were observed. Treatment with 1.0-mg/kg lip- DXR and 1.0-mg/kg lip+ DXR resulted in urinary albumin concentration of less than 3.0 and less than 1.0 g/liter, respectively. Free DXR, 1.0 mg/kg, resulted in a decline of serum albumin concentration from 27.8 +/- 3.2 g/liter to 9.6 +/- 4.2 g/liter. No such decline was observed after treatment with lip- DXR and lip+ DXR. Treatment with a 1.0-mg/kg dose of free DXR resulted in severe glomerular and tubular lesions which were not found after treatment with 1.0-mg/kg lip- DXR and 1.0 mg/kg lip+ DXR. Administration of lip- DXR resulted in lower DXR levels in cardiac and renal tissue compared to administration of free DXR. After administration of lip+ DXR, very low tissue and tumor DXR levels were found. In conclusion, treatment with lip- DXR or lip+ DXR resulted in a prolonged survival, less albuminuria, and higher serum albumin levels. Also, fewer lesions in heart and kidney were found, correlating with lower DXR levels in these organs. Only lip- DXR had the same antitumor effect as free DXR.},

Due to its ability to cross the blood--brain barrier, high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is the backbone for induction chemotherapy. This systematic review was conducted to observe outcomes among different HDMTX doses (low, {$<$}3 g/m2; intermediate, 3--4.9 g/m2; high, {$\geq$}5 g/m2) and regimens used in the treatment of PCNSL. A PubMed search resulted in 26 articles reporting clinical trials using HDMTX for PCNSL, from which 35 treatment cohorts were identified for analysis. The median dose of HDMTX used for induction was 3.5 g/m2 (interquartile range IQR, 3--3.5); the intermediate dose was most frequently used in the studies examined (24 cohorts, 69\%). Five cohorts used HDMTX monotherapy, 19 cohorts used HDMTX + polychemotherapy, and 11 cohorts used HDMTX + rituximab {\textpm} polychemotherapy. Pooled overall response rate (ORR) estimates for low, intermediate, and high dose HDMTX cohorts were 71\%, 76\%, and 76\%, respectively. Pooled 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) estimates for low, intermediate, and high HDMTX dose cohorts were 50\%, 51\%, and 55\%, respectively. Regimens that included rituximab showed a tendency to have higher ORR and 2-year PFS than those that did not include rituximab. These findings indicate that current protocols utilizing 3--4 g/m2 of HDMTX in combination with rituximab provide therapeutic efficacy in PCNSL.},

  abstract = {Pharmacokinetic drug interactions with viral protease inhibitors are of potential clinical importance. An in vitro model was applied to the quantitative identification of possible interactions of protease inhibitors with substrates of cytochrome P450-2D6. Biotransformation of desipramine (DMI) to hydroxydesipramine (OH-DMI), an index reaction used to profile activity of human cytochrome P450-2D6, was studied in vitro using human liver microsomes. Quinidine and four viral protease inhibitors currently used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection were tested as chemical inhibitors in this system. Formation of OH-DMI from DMI was consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, having a mean Km value of 11.7 microM (range: 9.9-15.3 microM). Quinidine, a highly potent and relatively selective inhibitor of P450-2D6, strongly inhibited OH-DMI formation with an apparent competitive mechanism, having a mean inhibition constant of 0.16 microM (range: 0.13-0.18 microM). All four protease inhibitors impaired OH-DMI formation; the pattern was consistent with a mixed competitive-noncompetitive mechanism. Mean inhibition constants (small numbers indicating greater inhibiting potency) were as follows: ritonavir, 4.8 microM; indinavir, 15.6 microM; saquinavir, 24.0 microM; nelfinavir, 51.9 microM. In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, coadministration of ritonavir with DMI inhibited DMI clearance by an average of 59\%. The in vitro findings, together with observed plasma ritonavir concentrations, provided a reasonable quantitative forecast of this interaction, whereas estimated unbound plasma or intrahepatic ritonavir concentrations yielded poor quantitative forecasts. Thus the in vitro model correctly identifies ritonavir as a potent and clinically important inhibitor of human P450-2D6. Other protease inhibitors may also inhibit 2D6 activity in humans, but with lower potency than ritonavir.},

In this paper, we evaluate the use of Stan with R and Torsten for population PK modeling of somatrogon, a recombinant long-acting growth hormone approved for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. As a software for Bayesian inference, Stan provides an easy way to conduct MCMC sampling for a wide range of models with efficient sampling algorithms, and there are several diagnostic tools to evaluate the MCMC convergence and other potential issues. Three different sets of priors were evaluated for estimation and prediction: a weakly informative uniform set, a moderately informative set, and a very informative set of priors. All three prior sets showed good performance and all chains mixed well. There were some minor differences in the final parameter posterior distributions while implementing different prior sets, but the posterior predictions covered the observations nicely, not only for the individuals included in posterior sampling but also for new individuals. The impact of a centered versus non-centered parameterization were evaluated, with the non-centered approach improving the estimation time, but it was still computationally intensive. Computational resources had the biggest impact on sampling time. Stan took approximately 2.5 h total for the MCMC sampling on a high-performance computing platform (6 cores) and may be reduced further with additional computational resources. The model and comparisons presented show that with adequate computational resources, the Bayesian approaches using Stan and Torsten are useful for population PK analysis, especially for the analysis of special populations, small sample datasets, and when complex model structures are needed.},

  abstract = {Proper handling of data below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) is crucial for accurate pharmacokinetic parameter estimation. The M3 method proposed by Beal uses a likelihood-based approach that is precise but has been reported to suffer from numerical issues in converging. Common alternatives include ignoring the BLQs (M1), imputing half of the lower limit of quantification and ignoring trailing BLQs (M6) or imputing zero (M7). The imputation methods fail to account for the additional uncertainty affecting imputed observations. We used NONMEM with FOCE-I/Laplace to compare the stability, bias, and precision of methods M1, M3, M6, M7, and modified versions M6+ and M7+ that inflate the additive residual error for BLQs. Real and simulated datasets with a two-compartment model were used to assess stability through parallel retries with perturbed initial estimates. The resulting differences in objective function values (OFV) were compared. Bias and precision were evaluated on simulated data using stochastic simulations and estimations. M3 yielded different OFV across retries ({\textpm}14.7), though the parameter estimates were similar. All other methods, except M7 ({\textpm}130), were stable. M3 demonstrated the best bias and precision (average rRMSE 18.7\%), but M6+ and M7+ performed comparably (26.0\% and 23.3\%, respectively). The unstable OFV produced by M3 represents a challenge when used to guide model development. Imputation methods showed superior stability, and including inflated additive error improved bias and precision to levels comparable with M3. For these reasons, M7+ (of simpler implementation than M6+) is an attractive alternative to M3, especially during model development.},

The purpose of this article is to analyze both the pharmacokinetic interpretation errors and opportunities underlying the presence of flip-flop pharmacokinetics during drug development. Flip-flop occurs when the rate of absorption is slower than the rate of elimination. If it is not recognized, it can create difficulties in the acquisition and interpretation of pharmacokinetic parameters. When flip-flop is expected or discovered, a longer duration of sampling may be necessary in order to avoid overestimation of fraction of dose absorbed. Common culprits of flip-flop disposition are modified dosage formulations; however, formulation characteristics such as the drug chemical entities themselves or the incorporated excipients can also cause the phenomenon. Yet another contributing factor is the physiological makeup of the extravascular site of administration. In this article, these causes of flip-flop pharmacokinetics are discussed with incorporation of relevant examples and the implications for drug development outlined.},

  abstract = {Objectives The rate of dermal toxicity has been shown to increase in patients receiving pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), particularly palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). However, it is difficult to diagnose and treat PLD-related PPE due to its delayed dermal performance, unclear pathogenetic mechanism, and the lack of specific preventive measures. The aim of this study was to provide potential management strategies for PPE associated with PLD. Methods The current article reviews the available data regarding the pharmacological and clinical aspects of PLD, including the formulation and pharmacokinetics of PLD, dose and schedule contribution to PPE, concomitant drugs affecting skin toxicity of PLD, the pathogenesis of PPE, and preventive measures and treatment of PLD-related PPE. Results The long circulation structure of polyethylene glycol liposomes may be one of the reasons for PPE. PLD has radically different pharmacokinetic characteristics, including prolonged blood circulation time, decreased body distribution volume, and slow clearance. Altering the schedules and doses of PLD or combining it with platinum compounds can optimise clinical efficacy and minimise the occurrence of PPE. Doses of 150--200\,mg of pyridoxine daily have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of PPE. Regional cooling and plasma filtration have been used for PPE prophylaxis. Conclusions To date, the mechanism of PPE induced by PLD remains unclear, and no complete preventive medication has been established. Further research and prospective randomised studies are needed to understand the management options in PLD-related PPE.},
