   abstract = {<p>There has been rising interest in using model‐informed precision dosing to provide personalized medicine to patients at the bedside. This methodology utilizes population pharmacokinetic models, measured drug concentrations from individual patients, pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and Bayesian estimation to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters and predict concentration‐time profiles in individual patients. Using these individualized parameter estimates and simulated drug exposure, dosing recommendations can be generated to maximize target attainment to improve beneficial effect and minimize toxicity. However, the accuracy of the output from this evaluation is highly dependent on the population pharmacokinetic model selected. This tutorial provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating, selecting, and validating a model for input and implementation into a model‐informed precision dosing program. A step‐by‐step outline to validate successful implementation into a precision dosing tool is described using the clinical software platforms Edsim++ and MwPharm++ as examples.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Establishing a dosing regimen that maximizes clinical benefit and minimizes adverse effects for novel therapeutics is a key objective for drug developers. Finding an optimal dose and schedule can be particularly challenging for compounds with a narrow therapeutic window such as in oncology. Modeling and simulation tools can be valuable to conduct in silico evaluations of various dosing scenarios with the goal to identify those that could minimize toxicities, avoid unscheduled dose interruptions, or minimize premature discontinuations, which all could limit the potential for therapeutic benefit. In this tutorial, we present a stepwise development of an adaptive dose simulation framework that can be used for dose optimization simulations. The tutorial first describes the general workflow, followed by a technical description with basic to advanced practical examples of its implementation in mrgsolve and is concluded with examples on how to use this in decision‐making around dose and schedule optimization. The adaptive simulation framework is built with pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic (i.e., biomarkers, activity markers, target engagement markers, efficacy markers), and safety models that include evaluations of unexplained interindividual and intraindividual variability and covariate impact, which can be replaced and expanded (e.g., combination setting, comparator setting) with user‐defined models. Subsequent adaptive simulations allow investigation of the impact of starting dose, dosing intervals, and event‐driven (exposure or effect) dose modifications on any end point. The resulting simulation‐derived insights can be used in quantitatively proposing dose and regimens that better balance benefit and adverse effects for further evaluation, aiding dose selection discussions, and designing dose modification recommendations, among others.</p>},
