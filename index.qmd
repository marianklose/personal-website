## About me

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Hi there! I'm Marian Klose, currently a PhD student at [Freie Universitaet Berlin](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/pharmazie/faecher/klinische_pharmazie/arbeitsgruppe_kloft/mitarbeiter/Doktoranden_innen/klose_marian/index.html){target="_blank"}, and part of the [PharMetrX](https://www.pharmetrx.de/){target="_blank"}  graduate research training program. I am directly supervised by [Prof. Charlotte Kloft](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/pharmazie/faecher/klinische_pharmazie/arbeitsgruppe_kloft/mitarbeiter/Leiterin/kloft_charlotte/index.html){target="_blank"} from Freie Universitaet Berlin and co-supervised by [Prof. Wilhelm Huisinga](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/en/professuren/mathematical-modelling-and-systems-biology/team/translate-to-english-prof-dr-wilhelm-huisinga){target="_blank"} from University of Potsdam.

How did I end up here? After my A-levels I did a work-and-travel year and then started studying chemistry and biochemisty. I realized that I wanted to work in a field that was a bit more applied, so I switched to pharmacy. There I got into pharmacometrics pretty early on and loved the mix of computer science, pharmacy, and math. After my studies, I headed to Florida for six months to work at the University of Florida's Center for Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology under supervison of [Prof. Stephan Schmidt](https://pharmacy.ufl.edu/profile/schmidt-stephan/){target="_blank"} and [Prof. Rodrigo Cristofoletti](https://pharmacy.ufl.edu/profile/cristofoletti-rodrigo/){target="_blank"}, and also did a three-month internship at Boehringer Ingelheim to see if my interest would remain steady. And I was still fascinated by pharmacometrics, so I decided to start my PhD and applied to the PharMetrX program — and here I am today!

In the field of pharmacometrics, not everything is perfectly documented. Thankfully, there are many helpful blogs and articles available that break down complex topics into simpler, more accessible concepts. Whenever I come across a concept I don’t fully understand (which happens quite often), I try to explain it to myself using a Quarto or RMarkdown document. Since I’m anyways creating these documents for myself, I thought I might as well share them as little blog posts. My goal really isn’t to produce perfectly polished content, but rather to document my own learning process and potentially help others who might be facing the same challenges.
