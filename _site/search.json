She just explained the concepts in a very easy-to-understand way and it is at the same time quite entertaining to read. Please check out her blog, if you haven’t already!\nI often explain new concepts to myself using Quarto or RMarkdown documents and I thought I might as well share them as little blog posts.

    "text": "Disclaimers\nBefore diving in, a few things to note:\n\nI’m not an expert in everything I write about; I’m learning as I go and simply documenting my process. Expect some mistakes along the way!\nEnglish is not my first language, so I rely on tools like ChatGPT and DeepL to help with writing. I also use tools like ChatGPT to generate ideas or to find good ways to visualize concepts.\nI do my best to give credit where it’s due and cite sources when appropriate. Much of what I share builds on others’ work, and I’m not trying to reinvent the wheel."

    "text": "Hi there! I’m Marian Klose, currently a PhD student at Freie Universitaet Berlin, and part of the PharMetrX graduate research training program. I am directly supervised by Prof. Charlotte Kloft from Freie Universitaet Berlin and co-supervised by Prof. Wilhelm Huisinga from University of Potsdam.\nHow did I ended up here? After my A-levels I did a work-and-travel year and then started studying chemistry and biochemisty. I realized that I wanted to work in a field that was a bit more applied, so I switched to pharmacy. There I got into pharmacometrics pretty early on and loved the mix of computer science, pharmacy, and math. After my studies, I headed to Florida for six months to work at the University of Florida’s Center for Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology under supervison of Prof. Stephan Schmidt and Prof. Rodrigo Cristofoletti, and also did a three-month internship at Boehringer Ingelheim to see if my interest would remain steady. And I was still fascinated by pharmacometrics, so I decided to start my PhD and applied to the PharMetrX program — and here I am today!\nIn the field of pharmacometrics, not everything is perfectly documented. Thankfully, there are many helpful blogs and articles available that break down complex topics into simpler, more accessible concepts. Whenever I come across a concept I don’t fully understand (which happens quite often), I try to explain it to myself using a Quarto or RMarkdown document. Since I’m anyways creating these documents for myself, I thought I might as well share them as little blog posts. My goal really isn’t to produce perfectly polished content, but rather to document my own learning process and potentially help others who might be facing the same challenges."
