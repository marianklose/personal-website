    "text": "1 Additive error models\nThe “classical” way (if I can call it that) of specifying an additive error model in NONMEM is as follows:\n\n\n\nclassical way (additive)\n\n$ERROR\nIPRED = F\nY = IPRED + EPS(1)\n\n$SIGMA\n0.0529\n\n\nIn this approach, RUV is defined directly in the $SIGMA block, where EPS(1) is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance of 0.0529:\n\\[EPS(1) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,0.0529)\\]\nIt is quite important to note that we are specifying variances in $SIGMA. Now the alternative way (my colleague called it the Uppsala way3) of coding the additive error model looks like this:\n\n\n\nalternative way (additive)\n\n$THETA\n0.23        ; RUV_ADD\n\n$ERROR\nIPRED = F\nSD_ADD = THETA(1)\nY = IPRED + SD_ADD * EPS(1)\n\n$SIGMA\n1 FIX\n\n\nHere, $SIGMA is fixed so EPS(1) has a variance of 1, effectively making it a standard normal distribution:\n\\[EPS(1) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\]\nBut we then multiply this random variable EPS(1) by a scaling factor SD_ADD (which is being estimated as a THETA parameter) before the product is being added to the individual predicted IPRED value:\n\n\n\nalternative way (additive)\n\nY = IPRED + SD_ADD * EPS(1)\n\n\nI am not super familiar what happens if we multiply a random variable with a scaling factor. So maybe it is a good idea to visualize what happens when we fix $SIGMA to 1 and multiply it by SD = 0.23. Let’s start with plotting a standard normal distribution ($SIGMA 1 FIX):\n\n\nCode\n# sample from standard normal distribution\nx &lt;- rnorm(100000, mean = 0, sd = 1)\nstd_norm &lt;- tibble(x = x, source = \"unscaled\")\n\n# plot\nstd_norm |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, fill = source)) +\n  geom_density(alpha=0.2)+\n  labs(title = \"Standard normal distribution\", x = \"\", y = \"Density\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    \"Source\",\n    values = c(\n      \"unscaled\" = \"#003049\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting standard deviation should be 1, and since \\(1^2 = 1\\), the resulting variance should also be 1. Let’s be sure and check our empirical estimates (it is a simulation, after all) to confirm this:\n\n\nCode\n# summarize data and calculate sd and variance\nstd_norm |&gt; \n  group_by(source) |&gt;   \n  summarize(\n    sd = sd(x) |&gt; signif(digits = 3),\n    var = var(x) |&gt; signif(digits = 3)\n  ) |&gt; \n  rename(\n    \"Source\" = source,\n    \"Standard Deviation\" = sd,\n    \"Variance\" = var\n  ) |&gt;\n  kbl() |&gt; kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nStandard Deviation\nVariance\n\n\n\n\nunscaled\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood. But what happens now to this standard normal distribution if we multiply the random variable with some scaling parameter \\(SD = 0.23\\)? Let’s find out:\n\n\nCode\n# set a seed\nset.seed(123)\n\n# multiply with W\nSD &lt;- 0.23\nx_scaled &lt;- x * SD\nstd_norm_scaled &lt;- tibble(x = x_scaled, source = \"scaled\")\n\n# combine both\nstd_norm_combined &lt;- bind_rows(std_norm, std_norm_scaled)\n\n# plot\nstd_norm_combined |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, fill = source)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)+\n  labs(title = \"Normal distributions: Impact of scaling factor SD\", x = \"\", y = \"Density\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    \"Source\",\n    values = c(\n      \"unscaled\" = \"#003049\",  # Blue color for original\n      \"scaled\" = \"#c1121f\"     # Orange color for scaled\n    )\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare the standard deviation and variance of both distributions:\n\n\nCode\n# summarize data and calculate sd and variance\nstd_norm_combined |&gt; \n  group_by(source) |&gt;   \n  summarize(\n    sd = sd(x) |&gt; signif(digits = 2),\n    var = var(x) |&gt; signif(digits = 2)\n  ) |&gt; \n  rename(\n    \"Source\" = source,\n    \"Standard Deviation\" = sd,\n    \"Variance\" = var\n  ) |&gt; \n  kbl() |&gt; \n  kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nStandard Deviation\nVariance\n\n\n\n\nscaled\n0.23\n0.053\n\n\nunscaled\n1.00\n1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the scaled distribution, we can see that the resulting standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is approximately equal to our scaling factor SD_ADD (which is 0.23) and the variance is \\(0.23^2 \\approx 0.053\\). This means that in our model code\n\n\n\nalternative way (additive)\n\nSD_ADD * EPS(1)\n\n\nthe SD_ADD parameter (specified via $THETA) is representing a standard deviation. Cool thing! Probably it’s not too surprising given my naming scheme, but anyways.4 Overall, both of these models should be equivalent:\n\n\n\nclassical way (additive)\n\n$SIGMA\n0.0529   ; variance\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nalternative way (additive)\n\n$THETA\n0.23   ; standard deviation\n\n$SIGMA\n1 FIX\n\n\nTo sum it up: We need to be careful with the units. If we use the classical way, we are estimating a variance via $SIGMA, but if we use the alternative way, we are estimating a standard deviation via $THETA and fix the $SIGMA to a standard normal. Typically, we would report the standard deviation (rather than the variance) if we use an additive model, and I think one of the advantages of the alternative way is that we directly read out the standard deviation from the parameter estimates (without the need to transform anything). Some also say that the estimation becomes more stable if we model the stochastic parts via $THETA, but I cannot judge if this is true or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying additive RUV via $THETA gives us a standard deviation\n\n\n\nWhenever we have an additive error model and we specify the RUV in the $THETA block (the alternative way), the resulting estimate is a standard deviation."

This is why we first calculate the standard deviation SD_PROP at the given prediction as:\n\n\n\nalternative way (proportional)\n\nSD_PROP = IPRED * THETA(1)\n\n\nThis already gives us an understanding of the units of THETA(1): it represents the coefficient of variation (CV) of the prediction IPRED. Why? A coefficient of variation represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. This is why we end up with a standard deviation (SD_PROP) if we multiply the prediction (IPRED) with the CV (THETA(1)). So we always have a fraction of the prediction representing our standard deviation at that point.\n\n2.1 An example\nSuppose we have a prediction (IPRED) of 10 mg/L and we want to show the resulting distribution. For the classical approach, we would specify a variance (EPS(1)) of 0.0225, and for the alternative way, we would specify a CV (THETA(1)) of 0.15. What do you think? Will this be equivalent or not?

In the classical way, we are given a variance of 0.0225. To get the standard deviation, we take the square root of the variance:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{EPS} = \\sqrt{0.0225} = 0.15\n\\] This means, that our random variable EPS(1) has a standard deviation of 0.15 mg/L in our classical model:\n\n\n\nclassical way (proportional)\n\nY = IPRED + IPRED * EPS(1)\n\n\nBy multiplying this EPS(1) by the prediction (IPRED) of 10 mg/L, we are scaling this random variable to have the (desired) standard deviation of the prediction distribution (PRED):\n\\[\n\\sigma_{Y} = 0.15 \\times 10 = 1.5 \\, \\text{mg/L}\n\\]\nIn the alternative way, we are directly estimating the coefficient of variation (CV) as 0.15.\n\n\n\nalternative way (proportional)\n\nSD_PROP = IPRED * THETA(1)\nY = IPRED + SD_PROP * EPS(1)\n\n\nWe are first calculating the respective standard deviation (SD_PROP) by multiplying CV with IPRED. We then turn this standard deviation into a random variable with this standard deviation by multiplying it with a random variable from a standard normal (EPS(1)). Also here, the respective standard deviation of the prediction distribution (PRED) is 1.5 mg/L:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{Y} = 0.15 \\times 10 = 1.5 \\, \\text{mg/L}\n\\]\nIn both cases, the resulting variability is the same, meaning both approaches lead to the same standard deviation of 1.5 mg/L. Again, it is a bit more convenient to specify the CV directly, as it is more intuitive and easier to interpret. And if the stability argument is true (see above), we would also make our estimation more robust this way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying proportional RUV in $THETA gives us a coefficient of variation\n\n\n\nWhenever we have a proportional error model and we specify the RUV in the $THETA block, the resulting estimate is a coefficient of variation."

But how do we combine these components?\n\n\n\nalternative way (combined)\n\nSD = SQRT(SD_PROP**2 + SD_ADD**2)\n\n\nWe can see that we first square both terms, then add them together, then take the square root. Sounds complicated - why not just add them directly together? This is because variances are additive when combining independent random variables, while standard deviations are not (Soch 2020). Written a bit more formally for two independent random variables (we typically assume the covariance to be 0 when modelling RUV):\n\\[\\mathrm{Var}(X + Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(X) + \\mathrm{Var}(Y)\\] In our case, SD_PROP and SD_ADD are standard deviations, so we must first square them to get the variances and then add them. However, we want to go back to a standard deviation before we multiply SD with EPS(1) (being fixed to 1). Therefore, we take the square root in the end.\nThis operation has always confused me a bit, but once I understood that I can sum up variances, but not standard deviations 5 it made more sense to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined error models\n\n\n\nWhen specifying a combined error model, the estimates in the $THETA block represent a standard deviation for the additive part and a coefficient of variation for the proportional part."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nPhysicians must constantly assess treatment-related risks based on limited data. This is particularly difficult in oncology, as compounds often have a narrow therapeutic window. For example, patients receiving high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) are at increased risk of toxicity if MTX elimination is delayed (MTX &gt; threshold of 0.2 µM for &gt;72 h post-dose). To timely identify these patients (‘delayed eliminators’), TDM is being performed until MTX concentrations drop below the threshold. However, early translation of MTX concentrations and clinical biomarkers into a risk score at the bedside can be challenging. A Bayesian-NLME framework allows to combine prior knowledge about the population with individual measurements. Evaluating its predictive performance in clinically relevant scenarios with unseen patients is crucial to determine the clinical utility of the obtained predictions. However, most published HD-MTX models lack such validation, leaving their clinical applicability uncertain."

Bayesian forecasting using mapbayr was conducted once MTX concentrations became available, including data from previous cycles. The predicted and observed times to threshold were compared for each time point within a cycle by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and the fraction of correctly identified delayed patients (true positive rate, TPR)."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjectives\nUnderstanding pharmacokinetic (PK) interindividual variability (IIV) can enable reaching optimal drug exposure, minimising therapeutic failure. Genotype-derived phenotypes are often applied to derive a patient’s individual clearance (iCL) but do not always translate into the optimal individual dose. Alternatively, the direct measurement of enzyme activity using a microdosed external probe could provide insights into the patient’s iCL and could be used in model-informed precision dosing (MIPD). Here, we propose the use of the CYP2D6 substrate yohimbine (YOH) as a probe to individualise the dosing of the selective oestrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (TAM). While YOH’s PK was previously characterised using intensive blood sampling over 24 hours [1], deriving YOH iCL (iCLYOH), which varies 1000-fold between normal and poor metabolisers, with less samples would be ideal. This iCL can then be used in a Bayesian framework to predict the optimal dose of other CYP2D6 substrates. After standard dosing of 20 mg TAM once daily, high IIV in TAM concentrations and its ~100-fold more active metabolite endoxifen (ENDX) is observed and attributed to variability in CYP2D6 activity [2]. Therefore, treatment with TAM would benefit from MIPD and thus we present this as a case study of using microdose-based activity measurement to individualise dosing of CYP metabolised drugs.\n\n\nMaterial/Methods\nA recent study investigating oral YOH as a predictor for CYP2D6 activity was used for PK model development [1], including the CYP2D6 genotype-derived phenotype, using NONMEM v. 7.4. The best-fitting model was then refitted to the data blinded for the attributed CYP2D6 activity score (AS) to mimic the application where this data is not available. To use the final model for Bayesian inference in a clinical setting, optimal sampling time points between 0.25 and 4 h post-dose were determined using optimal design analysis in R/Rstudio (v.3.6.3/1.3.959) applying the popED package (v.0.5.0). This design was evaluated by stochastically simulating YOH concentrations at the optimal timepoints to estimate MAP CL. The agreement between the MAP estimate and the iCL of the simulation was then evaluated: bias and precision were assessed using median estimation errors and median absolute estimation errors. To incorporate the ‘real-world’ small deviations from planned sampling times, simulated sampling times were drawn from a normal distribution (sd=5 min) around the planned sample. For the MIPD application, a published parent-metabolite TAM PK model [2] was selected. Based on the empirical Bayes estimates and the CYP2D6 AS of the patients in the original YOH model development dataset, iCLYOH for the blinded model application dataset were converted to CYP2D6 AS’s, which were implemented as covariates in the TAM model. Then ENDX exposure of 1000 virtual patients with the same AS were stochastically simulated after 20, 40 and 60 mg daily doses. The percentages of virtual patients reaching the target ENDX minimum steady state concentration of 5.97 ng/mL were calculated [3]. For each patient, the lowest dose resulting in &gt;90% of target attainment was selected as optimal dose.\n\n\nResults\nA two-compartmental model with first-order absorption and linear elimination best described the YOH data. The IIV on YOH CL was largely explained by including CYP2D6 activity as a covariate, leading to a reduction from 1,143 to 43.9 CV%. Based on the optimal experimental design analysis, one early (0.25 h) and one late (4 h) sample were sufficient to reliably estimate iCL. iCLYOH were linked to the following phenotypes: patients with iCLYOH≤6 L/h: poor metabolisers, 6&lt;iCLYOH&lt;180 L/h: intermediate metabolisers and iCLYOH≥180 L/h: normal metabolisers. The PK model and iCL estimation were successfully linked to the TAM model in order to provide dosing recommendations for TAM treatment based on 2 YOH samples.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study achieved TAM dose individualisation by using YOH derived CYP2D6 activity and MIPD. A clinical study where both TAM and YOH are administered could inform a direct link between iCLYOH and iCLTAM. This framework can be used for dose individualisation of other CYP substrates as long as a PK model and a probe is available; e.g. midazolam for CYP3A4 could be considered to expand this microdose-based activity measurement for individualised dosing and its utility should be investigated in prospective clinical trials. Furthermore, integration of the workflow in an easy-to-use tool would further encourage clinical application.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Vay, M.J. Meyer, A. Blank, G. Skopp, P. Rose, M.V. Tzvetkov, G.

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nPhysicians must constantly assess treatment-related risks based on limited data. This is particularly difficult in oncology, as compounds often have a narrow therapeutic window. For example, patients receiving high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) are at increased risk of toxicity if MTX elimination is delayed (MTX &gt; threshold of 0.2 µM for &gt;72 h post-dose). To timely identify these patients (‘delayed eliminators’), TDM is being performed until MTX concentrations drop below the threshold. However, early translation of MTX concentrations and clinical biomarkers into a risk score at the bedside can be challenging. A Bayesian-NLME framework allows to combine prior knowledge about the population with individual measurements. Evaluating its predictive performance in clinically relevant scenarios with unseen patients is crucial to determine the clinical utility of the obtained predictions. However, most published HD-MTX models lack such validation, leaving their clinical applicability uncertain."

    "text": "Methods\nClinical routine data of adult CNS-lymphoma patients receiving HD-MTX i.v. infusion (median duration 3.25 h) was retrospectively collected and split by ID into a training (75%) and a test (25%) cohort. Cycles exceeding 72 h to MTX&lt;0.2 µM were classified as delayed. To avoid biased parameter estimates due to a longer follow-up in delayed eliminators, censored observations (&lt;0.2 µM) were added every 24 h up to 22 days since the last observation &lt;0.2 µM per patient and cycle. Parameters were estimated using SAEM and M3 method in NONMEM 7.5.1. Pre-specified covariate relations were tested on parameters with variability using SCM. Per cycle, time-to-threshold predictions were evaluated at pre-dose, 10 h, 30 h, and 50 h after start of infusion using data available up to each time point. Bayesian forecasting using mapbayr was conducted once MTX concentrations became available, including data from previous cycles. The predicted and observed times to threshold were compared for each time point within a cycle by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and the fraction of correctly identified delayed patients (true positive rate, TPR)."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nThe training data (nID: 132, nCycl: 410, nMTX: 2906) was best described by a 3 cmt model with first-order disposition processes and variability on CL (IIV: 19.0%, IOV: 14.4%) and Q3 (IIV: 29.6%, IOV: 27.3%). CL was positively associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum albumin concentrations and negatively associated with C-reactive protein concentrations. Parameters were precisely estimated (SIR: 1.0%-26% RSE), with GOF and VPC plots demonstrating good agreement with the data.\nPredictivity results for the time to threshold in all cycles of the test cohort (nID: 44, nCycl: 137, nMTX: 985) were:\n\n\n\nTime Point\nMAE (h)\nTPR (%)\n\n\n\n\nPre-dose\n22.8\n30.6\n\n\n≤ 10 h\n22.2\n38.9\n\n\n≤ 30 h\n15.7\n61.1\n\n\n≤ 50 h\n11.9\n77.8\n\n\n\nAt pre-dose, the model showed poor identification of delayed eliminators (TPR) and low predictive accuracy (MAE). Including MTX concentrations at the end of infusion only slightly improved predictive performance, with a minor reduction in MAE (-0.6 h) and a small increase in TPR (+8.3% points). In contrast, incorporating additional data between 10 h and 30 h substantially improved predictive performance, increasing the TPR by 22.2% points and reducing MAE by 6.5 h compared to the 10 h time point. The 50 h time point showed the best predictive performance. Adding data from previous cycles improved TPR for early time points (pre-dose: 38% vs 10%; 10 h: 46% vs 20%), but worsened TPR for later time points (30 h: 58% vs 70%; 50 h: 77% vs 80%). A similar pattern was observed for MAE."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nDepending on the amount of data available for a given patient, the predictive performance of the NLME model ranged from poor to good. At early time points, the model showed substantial inaccuracy and insufficient identification of delayed eliminators. We conclude that TDM data beyond 10 h is essential for identifying at-risk patients. Next, we will extend the framework to a full Bayesian approach using Stan and Torsten and integrate it into an RShiny app."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nTLD-1 is a novel liposomal doxorubicin formulation with a small hydrodynamic liposome diameter of 60 nm (90 nm for Caelyx) and a high lipid-to-drug ratio. We present the final results of SAKK 65/16, a phase 1 first-in-human study to define TLD-1’s safety, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), preliminary activity and pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\n\nMethods\nWe included patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who failed standard treatment. TLD-1 was administered intravenously every 3 weeks up to a maximum of 9 cycles (6 cycles for anthracycline-pretreated patients) starting at 10 mg/m2, using accelerated dose escalation and a modified continual reassessment design. A subsequent comparative PK part with a randomized cross-over design used TLD-1 at the RP2D and assigned patients to a single cycle of Caelyx (first or second cycle), comparing the PK of TLD-1 and Caelyx.\n\n\nResults\n43 patients were enrolled between November 2018 and March 2023, incuding 30 patients in the dose-escalation part and 13 patients in the comparative PK part. Predominant tumor entities included breast cancer in 23 patients and gynecological cancers in 12 patients. TLD-1 RP2D was defined as 40 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks. No treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) G4 or G5 were reported. TRAE G3 included cumulative hand-foot syndrome in 5 (12%) patients, stomatitis in 3 (7%) patients and anemia in 2 (5%) patients. Partial tumor response was documented in 4 (9%) patients. In the comparative PK part, median terminal half-life of encapsulated doxorubicin was 118 hours (TLD-1) and 70 hours (Caelyx), respectively, while median terminal half-life was 122 hours (TLD-1) and 81 hours (Caelyx) for unencapsulated doxorubicin, driven by the rate-limiting release from the liposomes.\n\n\nConclusions\nTLD-1 at 40 mg/m2 every 3 weeks was safe and showed preliminary activity in patients with heavily pretreated solid malignancies. TLD-1 exhibits a lower clearance and prolonged plasma half-life compared to conventional liposomal doxorubicin formulations such as Caelyx, potentially resulting from decreased degradation by the mononuclear phagocyte system.\n\n\nClinical trial identification\nNCT03387917.\n\n\nEditorial acknowledgement\nLegal entity responsible for the study Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK).\n\n\nFunding\nInnomedica.\n\n\nDisclosure\nM.

    "text": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction\nModel-informed precision dosing (MIPD) supports clinical decision-making by leveraging mathematical models and individual drug or biomarker measurements [1]. A typical MIPD workflow involves estimating individual maximum a posteriori (MAP) values for parameters which include interindividual variability (IIV). MAP values represent the mode of the posterior distribution and are obtained by maximising the product of the likelihood of the data and the parameter’s prior distribution [2]. The selected prior distribution needs to properly reflect the uncertainty about the parameter and is often defined by a distribution around the covariate-adjusted typical parameter value with a variance given by the model’s IIV estimate. However, this representation of uncertainty is only accurate when the model closely represents the clinical population (CP). In reality, deviations between model and CP are expected [3]. This deviation gave rise to the method of machine learning (ML)-assisted flattening of model priors [4], where the variance of the prior is selectively increased to account for these deviations. While this method has shown considerable improvement in predictive performance for vancomycin [4], its potential benefit across other drugs has not been studied.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the impact of ML-driven flattening of priors on the predictive performance for five compounds which are commonly applied in Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) programs by conducting a simulation study.\n\n\nMethods\nFive compounds were investigated: vancomycin (VAN), meropenem (MEM), methotrexate (MTX), infliximab (IFX), and tacrolimus (TAC). To have a plausible representation of the differences between model and CP to which the model is applied, two published models per drug [5-14] were selected and split into a data-generating model (DM) and an applied model (AM) used for Bayesian forecasting.\nA plausible TDM dataset was simulated with the DM (n=5000) using mrgsolve [15]. The PK-Sim® [16] population builder was used to generate demographically realistic virtual patients. All other covariates were drawn from lognormal distributions based on reported point estimates. Two administrations, each followed by a single drug concentration measurement, were simulated for each individual. RUV was included to account for the expected noise in clinical readouts.\nMAP estimation using the AM was performed with prior weights λ=1 and λ=1/8 for standard priors (SP) and flattened priors (FP), respectively. While the first concentration was included for MAP estimation, the second was used as a reference to evaluate the predictive performance. For each patient and λ, the residual between prediction and withheld datapoint was calculated.\nThe labeled dataset was then split into a training/test cohort (75%/25%) to build a ML model which predicts whether FP or SP should be applied for a given individual. All ML steps were conducted using the tidymodels [17] framework in R. The XGBoost (XGB) algorithm [18] was employed, using a 5-fold cross-validation with 5 repeats and a grid search for hyperparameter tuning. Optimal hyperparameters were selected based on precision.\nTo assess the impact of the method on the predictive performance of the model, the test dataset was bootstrapped (n=1000). For each sample, RMSE and MPE along with their relative improvement compared to SP were calculated across patients.\n\n\nResults\nResults from the simulation study, presented as the median relative improvement (-) or deterioration (+) compared to SP, were:\n\nVAN\n\nRMSE: -16.0% (-11 to -22% [4])\nMPE: -40.8% (-42 to -74% [4]) -MEM\nRMSE: -0.12%\nMPE: -2.89%\n\nMTX\n\nRMSE: +1.06%\nMPE: -4.15%\n\nIFX\n\nRMSE: -11.8%\nMPE: +1.69%\n\nTAC\n\nRMSE: -32.6%\nMPE: +18.0%\n\n\nOverall, the simulated impact ranged from -40.8% to +1.06% (RMSE) and -16.0% to +18.0% (MPE). Precision for the test dataset was 72.1% (VAN), 25.8% (MEM), 32.8% (MTX), 37.9% (IFX), and 71.3% (TAC).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe predicted improvements in RMSE and MPE for VAN are in agreement with the reported values. However, the impact of ML driven-flattening of priors on the predictive performance for other drugs varied substantially: The largest reduction in RMSE/MPE was indeed found for VAN with heterogenous improvements and even deteriorations for the other compounds. Missing impact of modified priors was also previously reported [19]. Moving forward, we plan to extend the investigation to identify variables which potentially explain the observed differences."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjectives\nOxycodone, a widely used opioid to treat moderate to severe pain, is subject of pharmacogenomic debate. After CYP2D6 mediated formation of oxymorphone (60 times higher μ-opioid receptor affinity than the parent [1]) it undergoes conjugation via UGT2B7. Two polymorphic enzymes are involved in this path, which may lead to high variability in oxymorphone exposure and response. In addition, 45% of the dose is metabolized to noroxycodone via CYP3A4. A recent publication by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium stated that there is ‘insufficient evidence’ to guide clinical practice at the moment [2]. Hence, the objective of our work was to investigate the impact of CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 gene-drug-interactions (GDI) and CYP-mediated drug-drug-interactions (DDI) on the PK of oxycodone using PBPK modelling.\n\n\nMethods\nGastroPlus 9.8.2 was used to build a PBPK model in a bottom-up approach. Drug-specific parameters were derived from reported in vitro or in vivo data; otherwise, in silico predictions were used. Vmax values were optimized to match reported mass balance and urinary excretion data. For the wild type UGT2B7H and the mutated allele UGT2B7Y, Vmax and Km values from literature [3] were weighted by the prevalence of the genotype. The verified PBPK models were applied to interrogate the impact of combined GDI and DDI on oxycodone and its metabolites exposures. The impact of such interactions was assessed by comparing drug exposure (AUC) in each simulated scenario versus oxycodone and metabolites AUCs in a CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 normal metabolizer without comedication.\n\n\nResults\n97% of predicted AUC values for oxycodone and its metabolites were within a 1.5-fold error range. In clinical DDI studies 95% of changes in AUC metabolite-to-parent-ratios were predicted within a 2.0-fold error range. Simulation results indicate that CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (UM) / UGT2B7 poor metabolizers (PM) have a 2.1-fold higher AUC for oxymorphone compared with normal metabolizers (NM). In CYP2D6 PM / UGT2B7 NM the AUC for oxymorphone was decreased by 3.1-fold and the AUC for oxycodone was increased by 1.2-fold. The highest exposure was predicted for CYP2D6 UM / UGT2B7 PM receiving a single dose of 400 mg ketoconazole. A 2.6-fold AUC increase for oxycodone and a 4.3-fold AUC increase for oxymorphone was predicted. The lowest exposure is expected for CYP2D6 PM / UGT2B7 NM receiving 600 mg rifampicin QD. The AUC for oxycodone decreased 5.8-fold and the AUC of oxymorphone decreased 21.1-fold.\n\n\nConclusions\nSo far, variability in oxycodone PKPD was attempted to be explained by CYP2D6 GDIs or DDIs alone. However, our research shows that not only the formation of oxymorphone but also the metabolism of oxymorphone via UGT2B7 should be considered. Some groups – especially in combined GDI and DDI scenarios – are expected to have significant over- or underexposure. For example, a CYP2D6 UM and UGT2B7 PM has high formation of oxymorphone and low clearance, which may lead to accumulation. These effects are amplified in DDI settings and should be considered in practice.\n\n\nCitations\n[1] Volpe et al. (2011) Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology (59)\n[2] Crews et al. (2021) Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (110)\n[3] Coffman et.al.

While CYP2D6-mediated gene-drug-interactions (GDIs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are well-studied, they only account for a portion of the variability in oxycodone and oxymorphone exposure. The combined impact of CYP2D6-mediated GDIs and DDIs, CYP3A4-mediated DDIs, and UGT2B7 GDIs is not fully understood yet and hard to study in head-to-head clinical trials given the relatively large number of scenarios.

The verified model was then applied to determine the dose-exposure relationship of oxycodone and oxymorphone stratified by CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 phenotypes respectively, and administered perpetrators of CYP-based drug interactions. Our simulations demonstrate that the combination of CYP2D6 UM and a UGT2B7Y (268) mutation may lead to a 2.3-fold increase in oxymorphone exposure compared to individuals who are phenotyped as CYP2D6 NM / UGT2B7 NM. The extent of oxymorphone exposure increases up to 3.2-fold in individuals concurrently taking CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. Inhibition of the CYP3A4 pathway results in a relative increase in the partial metabolic clearance of oxycodone to oxymorphone. Oxymorphone is impacted to a higher extent by GDIs and DDIs than oxycodone. We predict oxymorphone exposure to be highest in CYP2D6 UMs/UGT2B7 PMs in the presence of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 index inhibitor) and lowest in CYP2D6 PMs/UGT2B7 NMs in the presence of rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 index inducer) covering a 55-fold exposure range."

Our simulations demonstrate that the combination of CYP2D6 UM and a UGT2B7Y (268) mutation may lead to a 2.3-fold increase in oxymorphone exposure compared to individuals who are phenotyped as CYP2D6 NM / UGT2B7 NM. The extent of oxymorphone exposure increases up to 3.2-fold in individuals concurrently taking CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. Inhibition of the CYP3A4 pathway results in a relative increase in the partial metabolic clearance of oxycodone to oxymorphone. Oxymorphone is impacted to a higher extent by GDIs and DDIs than oxycodone. We predict oxymorphone exposure to be highest in CYP2D6 UMs/UGT2B7 PMs in the presence of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 index inhibitor) and lowest in CYP2D6 PMs/UGT2B7 NMs in the presence of rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 index inducer) covering a 55-fold exposure range."

    "text": "3.1 Starting with an example\nI would say that many of us naturally think Bayesian, even if we are not aware of it or if we don’t label it that way. At its core, Bayesian statistics is about updating your beliefs once new data or information becomes available. Let’s consider an example from the real-world to illustrate this idea.\nImagine you drive to work every day. If someone would ask you “How long will it take you to get to work tomorrow?”, you would probably have a good idea, simply based on your past experiences. 30 minutes might be your best guess, but would you bet money that it will be exactly 30 minutes? Probably not, as you will always have some uncertainty associated with it. Perhaps something between 20 and 40 minutes would be reasonable based on your previous trips. Now, let’s assume you get into your car the next morning and after 25 minutes, you have made it halfway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A traffic jam on your way to work. Credits: Aayush Srivastava, Pexels.\n\n\n\nWould you stick to your initial belief that it will take you 30 minutes? Probably not, you would likely revise it (or try to break all speed limits). But would you simply double the 25 minutes to predict a 50-minute commute? This is also unlikely, given your experience suggesting that 40 minutes is usually the upper limit. So, maybe you would adjust your estimate to 38 minutes, assuming that the traffic will get better soon. This is Bayesian thinking in action: Updating your beliefs with new data. But so far without any equation and rather based on gut-feeling."

    "text": "3.2 Terminology\nNow, let’s map this real-world scenario to some Bayesian terminology. There are three key components in every Bayesian analysis:\n\nPrior: Your initial belief - 30 minutes, plus some uncertainty.\nLikelihood: The new data - taking 25 min to cover half the distance and suggesting 50 min for the full trip.\nPosterior: Your updated estimate - now around 38 minutes, combining prior and likelihood.\n\nBayesian analysis starts with a prior, which you revise using new data (likelihood) to obtain the posterior. In pharmacometrics, we often encounter two levels of complexity when it comes to Bayes:\n\nMAP / EBE: Simply focuses on the mode of the posterior distribution and ignores its uncertainty.\nFull Bayesian: Considers the entire posterior distribution, not just the mode or a point estimate.\n\nMany pharmacometricians use MAP estimates due to their computational simplicity and their direct integration into standard NLME routines, while full Bayesian methods offer a more comprehensive view by integrating uncertainty even after new data became available. Full Bayesian methods are more and more used in the field, also thanks to some nice tutorials by Margossian, Zhang, and Gillespie (2022) for Stan/Torsten and by Johnston et al. (2024) for NONMEM itself, both from the Metrum Research Group."

Instead, we typically use Bayesian estimation to individualize the model parameters for a given individual \\(i\\), which has a set of unique observations \\(Y_{i}\\). This concept was first introduced to the pharmacometric community by Sheiner, Rosenberg, and Melmon (1972), if I am not mistaken. On the one hand, MAP estimation happens during model building, at each iteration step 2 and then after the actual estimation has finished, at the POSTHOC step. On the other hand, it is also used in MIPD settings as described above. The approach remains the same, and we will later have a look at a simple pharmacokinetic example to illustrate this.\nSo far we used a relatable example rather focusing on the intuition behind Bayesian thinking. Now we want to dive a bit into the mathematics behind it to be able to formally reproduce a simple Bayesian MAP estimation in R."

Working with an unnormalized posterior is acceptable when our when we solely care about finding the mode of the posterior distribution (MAP estimate), as normalization is unnecessary in this scenario. But how exactly do we calculate the MAP estimate?"

    "text": "5.3 MAP estimation\nTo find the most likely parameter for an individual, we must identify the maximum of the posterior distribution (MAP estimate). Mathematically, this involves finding the parameter \\(\\eta_i^*\\) that maximizes the posterior:\n\\[\\eta_i^* = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}~ p(\\eta_i|Y_{i}) = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}~ p(\\eta_i) \\cdot \\prod_{j=1}^{m} p(Y_{ij}|\\eta_i) \\tag{6}\\]\nDealing with products of small probability densities can be cumbersome (and mathematically instable), so taking the logarithm simplifies the calculation:\n\\[\\eta_i^* = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}~ \\log(p(\\eta_i|Y_{i})) = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}~ \\log(p(\\eta_i)) + \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\log(p(Y_{ij}|\\eta_i)) \\tag{7}\\]\nIn the end, we would have to use a numerical optimizer function to explore the parameter space of \\(\\eta_i\\) and locate the maximum of the posterior distribution (\\(\\eta_i^*\\)). To fully express the equation, we must define both the log prior \\(\\log(p(\\eta_i))\\) and log likelihood \\(\\log(p(Y_{ij}|\\eta_i))\\) terms. Let’s explore these in detail.\n\n5.3.1 Prior term\nThe prior distribution \\(p(\\eta_i)\\) captures our inital beliefs and uncertainties regarding \\(\\eta_i\\) before observing the data. Bayesian methods allow to incorporate prior knowledge through various distributions and parameters (which is why Bayesians are sometimes being criticized of being too subjective). In pharmacometrics, a common approach is using a prior based on a previously estimated model, typically a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance \\(\\omega^2_{CL}\\) estimated from the NLME model. In contrast to other disciplines, the choice of our priors is generally less controversial, although there has been recent discussion regarding whether this one-approach-fits-all is always appropriate or if priors should be adjusted (e.g., flattened compared to the NLME estimate) in certain situations. See Hughes and Keizer (2021) for more information. The general “role” of the prior term is that strong deviations from the “typical” individual should only be considered when it allows us do substantially better explain the observed data. I like to see it as some kind of penalty function which prevents us from doing a potentially flawed curve fitting exercise. The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution can be used to calculate its contribution:\n\\[p(\\eta_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\omega^2}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\eta_i-\\mu)^2}{2\\omega^2}\\right) \\tag{8}\\]\nSince \\(\\mu\\) is typically 0, this simplifies to:\n\\[p(\\eta_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\omega^2}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\eta_i^2}{2\\omega^2}\\right) \\tag{9}\\]\nTaking the log yields:\n\\[\\log(p(\\eta_i)) = -0.5 \\log(2\\pi\\omega^2) - \\frac{\\eta_i^2}{2\\omega^2} \\tag{10}\\]\nNow, we can compute the prior term for any given individual \\(\\eta_i\\), using variance \\(\\omega^2_{CL}\\) (e.g., 0.11) from our NLME model. If we have a good reason to believe that our prior should be different (e.g., we apply our model to another population), we could adjust the variance accordingly (as described in Hughes and Keizer (2021)).\n\n\n5.3.2 Likelihood term\nThe likelihood term \\(p(Y_{ij}|\\eta_i)\\) is the probability of observing the data point \\(Y_{ij}\\) given the parameter \\(\\eta_i\\). As we usually assume the residuals of our model predictions to be normally distributed, we again use the normal distribution PDF:\n\\[p(Y_{ij}|\\eta_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(Y_{ij}-f(x_{ij}; \\eta_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\tag{11}\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\): observed data point for individual \\(i\\) at time \\(j\\)\n\\(f(x_{ij}; \\eta_i)\\): model prediction for individual \\(i\\) at time \\(j\\), given parameter \\(\\eta_i\\)\n\\(\\sigma^2\\): variance representing residual unexplained variability (RUV)\n\nTaking the log yields:\n\\[\\log(p(Y_{ij}|\\eta_i)) = -0.5 \\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{(Y_{ij}-f(x_{ij}; \\eta_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\tag{12}\\]\nPlease note that in our case (a combined additive and proportional RUV model), \\(\\sigma^2\\) represents the combined variances at time \\(t_{ij}\\) and prediction \\(f(x_{ij})\\). As the structural solution of our model, \\(f(x_{ij})\\), is a constant for a given \\(t_{ij}\\), we can compute the combined variance as\n\\[\\sigma^2 = \\sigma^2_{prop} \\cdot f(x_{ij})^2 + \\sigma^2_{add} \\tag{13}\\]\nTherefore, we later have to calculate the \\(\\sigma^2\\) for each data point \\(Y_{ij}\\) individually."

I was using the model from the previous blogpost, which only had an additive error and was missing the INTERACTION option (which doesn’t matter if you are just using a constant additive error). With the newly introduced proportional error, I then had a mismatch between my calculations and the reference and I couldn’t figure out why. The missing INTERACTION was the solution, as with the introduction of the proportional error the RUV does not remain constant (which NONMEM is assuming when INTERACTION is missing). Lesson learned!↩︎"

    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nIn this (somewhat lengthy) document I want to share my attempt at understanding and reproducing NONMEM’s objective function in R. Of course you can use NONMEM effectively without knowing the exact calculations behind the objective function and I did so myself for quite a while. But I believe that it’s helpful to have some understanding of what’s happening under the hood, even if it’s just to some extent. Calculating the objective function manually and understanding the math behind the estimation has always been on my bucket list, but I never really knew where to start. After getting some very helpful input during the PharMetrX (2024) A5 module, I felt ready to give it at least a try. So, here we are!"

    "section": "1.2 Structure",
    "text": "1.2 Structure\nLet me briefly outline how I structured this document. The main goal is to manually calculate the objective function in R using straight line equations. Furthermore, I would like to visualize its 3D surface to see the path the estimation algorithm is taking. I also want to reproduce two key steps associated with the estimation: The COVARIANCE step to assess the parameter precision and the POSTHOC step to get individual parameter estimates. As we try to work through these calculations, I also aim to explore and explain to myself some of the theory and intuition behind concepts and calculations along the way.\nTo achieve this, we will first define a simple one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with intravenous bolus administration and first-order elimination (Section 2). Afterwards we will use this model to simulate some virtual concentration-time data (Section 3), which we will then fit using the Laplacian estimation (Section 4) to obtain a reference solution. I chose the Laplacian algorithm because it makes fewer assumptions and simplifications compared to FOCE or FO. It should be easier to go from Laplacian to FOCE-I than vice versa.\nThen, in the biggest part of this document, we will try to construct the equations needed to calculate the objective function value for a given set of parameters and understand why we are taking each step (Section 5). After this is done, we will implement the functions in R (Section 6), reproduce each iteration of the NONMEM run and compare the results to the reference solution.\nFinally, the reward for all the hard work: We will visualize the objective function surface in a 3D plot (Section 7). This should give us a better understanding of the search algorithm and the behavior of the objective function in dependence of the parameter estimates.\nAfter that, we will attempt a complete estimation directly in R using the optim() function (Section 8) instead of only reproducing the objective function based on the iterations NONMEM took. We will compare our R-based parameter estimates against those obtained by NONMEM and discuss any differences.\nFollowing this, we will mimick the COVARIANCE step by retrieving and inverting the Hessian matrix (Section 9) obtained during the R-based optimization to assess parameter precision (relative standard errors). In a last step, we will then calculate the individual ETAs by reproducing the POSTHOC step (Section 10) and comparing the results against NONMEM’s outputs."

    "text": "1.4 Disclaimer\nBefore we get started, I want to note a few disclaimers to ward off any imposter syndrome that might kick in. I’m just a PhD student, not formally trained in mathematics or statistics, and I’m learning as I go. If you’re expecting an entirely error-free derivation with coherent statistical notation, this is not be the best resource. You better go with Wang (2007) in that case. My focus here is more about the intuition and maybe about developing a general understanding of the underlying processes.\nMuch of the content in this document is based on the work of others, and there’s not a lot of original thought here. I’ve relied heavily on several key publications (e.g., Wang (2007)), gained a lot of intuition from the PharMetrX (2024) A5 module, had important input from colleagues (see above) and used tools like Wolfram/Mathematica for some calculations and ChatGPT for parts of the writing. With that being said, let’s start!"

The selected time points are 0.01, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours. To my understanding, it is crucial to have at least two observations per individual to reliably estimate inter-individual variability, as having only one observation per individual would make it impossible to distinguish between inter-individual variability and residual variability.\nThe dataset includes dosing records (EVID = 1) and observation records (EVID = 0). For now the dependent variable (DV) will be flagged to -99 since we will simulate these values in the following steps. Here is how our input dataset looks like:\n\n\nCode\n# generate NONMEM input dataset for n individuals with 3 observations at different timepoints\nn_ind &lt;- 10\nn_obs &lt;- 5\ntimepoints &lt;- c(0.01, 3, 6, 12, 24)\n\n# observation events (EVID == 0)\nobs_input &lt;- tibble(\n  ID = rep(1:n_ind, each = n_obs),\n  TIME = rep(timepoints, n_ind),\n  EVID = 0,\n  AMT = 0,\n  RATE = 0,\n  DV = -99, # DV is what we want to simulate\n  MDV = 0\n)\n\n# dosing events (EVID == 1)\ndosing_input &lt;- tibble(\n  ID = rep(1:n_ind, each = 1),\n  TIME = 0,\n  EVID = 1,\n  AMT = 100,\n  RATE = 0,\n  DV = 0,\n  MDV = 1\n)\n\n# bind together and sort by ID and TIME\ninput_data &lt;- bind_rows(obs_input, dosing_input) |&gt; \n  arrange(ID, TIME)\n\n# show input data\ninput_data |&gt; \n  head(n=10) |&gt; \n  mytbl()\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nTIME\nEVID\nAMT\nRATE\nDV\nMDV\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.00\n1\n100\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n0.01\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n1\n3.00\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n1\n6.00\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n1\n12.00\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n1\n24.00\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n2\n0.00\n1\n100\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n2\n0.01\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n2\n3.00\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n2\n6.00\n0\n0\n0\n-99\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# save data to file\nwrite_csv(input_data, paste0(base_path, \"data/input_for_sim/input_data.csv\"))\n# write_csv(input_data, \"C:\\\\Users\\\\mklose\\\\Desktop\\\\G\\\\Mitarbeiter\\\\Klose\\\\Miscellaneous\\\\NLME_reproduction_R\\\\data\\\\input_for_sim\\\\input_data.csv\")\n\n\nWe arbitrarily decided that each individual receives the same dose of 100 mg at time 0. Same dose fits all, right? We can see that at 0.01, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after dosing we encoded sampling events (EVID = 0). We can now plug this dataset into NONMEM and simulate these concentrations!"

It tells us if the minimization was successful, if there has been any rounding errors, zero gradients, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PsN sumo output summarizing the minimization process.\n\n\n\nIn this screenshot we can also already see our maximum likelihood estimates for THETA and OMEGA and their associated relative standard errors.\n\n\n4.2.3 Iteration information\nBut which steps did the NONMEM algorithm take to end up in the maximum likelihood estimate? We can read in the .ext file, which contains information about the iterations of the estimation process and also the objective function value at each iteration. Here is how it looks like:\n\n\nCode\n# Read the data, skipping the first line\next_file &lt;- read_table(paste0(base_path, \"models/estimation/1cmt_iv_est.ext\"), skip = 1)\n\n# keep only positive iterations\next_file &lt;- ext_file |&gt; \n  filter(ITERATION &gt;= 0)\n\n# rename columns\next_file &lt;- ext_file |&gt; \n  rename(\n    CL = \"THETA1\",\n    V = \"THETA2\",\n    RUV_VAR = \"SIGMA(1,1)\",\n    IIV_VAR = \"OMEGA(1,1)\"\n  )\n\n# Show the tibble\next_file |&gt; \n  head(n=10) |&gt; \n  mytbl()\n\n\n\n\n\nITERATION\nCL\nV\nRUV_VAR\nIIV_VAR\nOBJ\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.100000\n3.15\n0.1\n0.1500000\n41.845437\n\n\n1\n0.168370\n3.15\n0.1\n0.4839690\n-2.743076\n\n\n2\n0.163689\n3.15\n0.1\n0.3881430\n-3.068198\n\n\n3\n0.216552\n3.15\n0.1\n0.1465500\n-11.297115\n\n\n4\n0.216552\n3.15\n0.1\n0.1465500\n-11.297115\n\n\n5\n0.253493\n3.15\n0.1\n0.0862428\n-12.418728\n\n\n6\n0.243287\n3.15\n0.1\n0.1171540\n-12.789118\n\n\n7\n0.246139\n3.15\n0.1\n0.1111950\n-12.823615\n\n\n8\n0.246715\n3.15\n0.1\n0.1099530\n-12.824589\n\n\n9\n0.246682\n3.15\n0.1\n0.1100200\n-12.824593\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, we have 10 entries/rows in the .ext file. The first row, iteration 0, contains the initial estimates (which we have provided in the model code) and its associated objective function value. Then we have iterations 1-8, which are intermediate steps. Finally, we are going to end up in iteration 9, at which point the convergence criterium was fulfilled and the estimation process has ended.\nThe columns carry the following information:\n\nITERATION = iteration number\nCL = Typical value of clearance in the population\nV = Volume of distribution (fixed)\nRUV_VAR = Variance of the residual unexplained variability (fixed)\nIIV_VAR = Variance of the inter-individual variability\nOBJ = Objective function value\n\nWe can use this output file to visualize the change in parameter values and objective function value over the iteration number, so we get a better understanding what is going on during the estimation steps:\n\n\nCode\n# Visualize\next_file |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(CL, V, RUV_VAR, IIV_VAR, OBJ), names_to = \"parameter\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=ITERATION, y=value))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~parameter, scales=\"free\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(x=\"Iteration\", y=\"Estimation diagnostic\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Estimation diagnostics over iterations\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Iterative diagnostics of the NONMEM estimation process, showing the progression of clearance, inter-individual variability, and objective function values over 10 iterations. Fixed parameters (RUV_VAR, V) remain constant.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, the reproduction of the objective function value for a given set of parameters will be the main goal and this .ext file provides us with the reference solution. I actually don’t want to go down the rabbit hole of trying to reproduce the math behind these optimization algorithms. However, in Section 8, we are going to at least use the optim function in R to partly reproduce the search algorithm.\nIn the next big chapter we will try to understand the theory behind calculating the log-likelihood needed for the objective function based on our simple example."

    "text": "5.1 Statistical model\nIn our little example we assume to have a (simple) hierarchical nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model, for which we want to conduct the parameter estimation. To my understanding the hierarchical structure is given by having variability defined on a population (=parameter) level and an individual (=observation) level, while the individual level depends on the parameter level. Let’s have a closer look to both of these levels.\n\n5.1.1 Population (parameter) level\nThe population level is represented by an inter-individual variability (IIV) term, which assumes a log-normal distribution around a typical parameter value. In this simplified example we only consider IIV on clearance and do not consider any other random effects. The population (or parameter) level can be defined as follows:\n\\[CL_i = \\theta_{TVCL} \\cdot e^{\\eta_{i}},~~~~~\\eta_{i} \\sim N(0, \\omega^2) \\tag{1}\\]\nHere, the individual clearance (\\(CL_i\\)) is modeled as a log-normally distributed parameter, where (\\(\\theta_{\\text{TVCL}}\\)) is the typical clearance value and \\(\\eta_{i}\\) is a random effect accounting for inter-individual variability (IIV). We assume that this random effect follows a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \\(\\omega^2\\). An example plot of such a population level is shown below:\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Define population parameters\ntheta_TVCL &lt;- 10  # Typical clearance (L/h)\nomega_sq &lt;- 0.2   # Variance of IIV on clearance\nomega &lt;- sqrt(omega_sq)  # Standard deviation of IIV\nnum_individuals &lt;- 5000    # Number of individuals in the population\n\n# Simulate individual random effects\neta_i &lt;- rnorm(num_individuals, mean = 0, sd = omega)\n\n# Compute individual clearances\nCL_i &lt;- theta_TVCL * exp(eta_i)\n\n# Create a data frame for plotting\npopulation_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Individual = 1:num_individuals,\n  eta_i = eta_i,\n  CL = CL_i\n)\n\n# Calculate density for annotation placement\ndensity_CL &lt;- density(CL_i)\nmax_density &lt;- max(density_CL$y)\n\n# Create the ggplot\np_pop &lt;- ggplot(population_data, aes(x = CL)) +\n  # Histogram of clearance values\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.5, fill = \"lightgreen\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  # Density curve\n  geom_density(color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1) +\n  # Vertical line for typical clearance\n  geom_vline(xintercept = theta_TVCL, color = \"blue\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  # Labels and theme\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population level: Clearance\",\n    x = \"Clearance (L/h)\",\n    y = \"Density\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  # Annotation for Typical Clearance\n  annotate(\"text\", x = theta_TVCL + 5, y = max_density * 0.9,\n           label = expression(theta[TVCL]~\": Typical Clearance\"),\n           color = \"blue\", hjust = 0) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = theta_TVCL + 5, y = max_density * 0.9,\n                   xend = theta_TVCL, yend = max_density * 0.8),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), color = \"blue\") +\n  # Annotation for IIV\n  annotate(\"text\", x = theta_TVCL + 13, y = max_density * 0.6,\n           label = expression(IIV~\"(\"~omega^2~\")\"),\n           color = \"darkgreen\", hjust = 0.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = theta_TVCL + 10, y = max_density * 0.6,\n                   xend = theta_TVCL+3, yend = max_density * 0.55),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), color = \"darkgreen\")\n\n# Display the plot\nprint(p_pop)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Distribution of clearance values at the population level, modeled as a log-normal distribution. The dashed blue line indicates the typical clearance value , while the green histogram and curve represent the density of clearance values in the population, accounting for inter-individual variability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot represents the population level of our model, where the clearance values are sampled from a log-normal distribution around the typical clearance value. The dashed line represents the typical clearance value \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\), and the green curve/bars represents the distribution of clearances in the population.\nThe random effect \\(\\eta_i\\) itself follows a normal distribution \\(N(0, \\omega^2)\\) and is visualized below:\n\n\nCode\n# plot histogram\npopulation_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=eta_i)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), color=\"black\", fill=\"lightblue\", binwidth = 0.05, alpha=0.7) +\n  labs(x=\"ETA\", y = \"Density\", title = \"Population level: ETA\",)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1)+\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of ETA values at the population level, following a normal distribution centered around 0. The dashed line indicates 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Individual (observation) level\nThe individual level on the other hand is defined by the observed and predicted concentrations for each subject. The predictions are based on the structural model and dependent on the individual parameters (which can be treated as a random variable, in our case CL). The individual level also incorporates residual unexplained variability (RUV), which distribution tells us how to define the likelihood function in the end. The individual level can be defined by:\n\\[Y_{ij} \\mid CL_i = f(x_{ij}; CL_i) + \\epsilon_{ij},~~~~~\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\tag{2}\\] where we can note that:\n\n\\(Y_{ij}\\) is the observed concentration for the \\(i^{th}\\) individual at the \\(j^{th}\\) time point, conditionally distributed given the individual’s clearance \\(CL_i\\).\n\\(f(x_{ij}; CL_i)\\) is the predicted concentration. It depends on \\(CL_i\\) (the individual clearance) and \\(x_{ij}\\) (all the information about covariates, dosing and sampling events for the \\(i^{th}\\) individual at the \\(j^{th}\\) time point).\n\\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the realization of the residual unexplained variability for the \\(i^{th}\\) individual at the \\(j^{th}\\) time point. It typically follows a normal distribution \\(N(0, \\sigma^2)\\)\n\nIn our example we have two random variables, \\(Y_{ij}\\) and \\(CL_i\\), with parameters \\(\\beta := (\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2, \\sigma^2)\\). In our example we just want to estimate the typical clearance \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\) and the IIV on clearance \\(\\omega^2\\). The residual unexplained variability \\(\\sigma^2\\) is assumed to be known and fixed. The individual level with RUV is illustrated below:\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Define model parameters\ntheta_TVCL &lt;- 10  # Typical clearance (L/h)\nomega &lt;- 0.447    # IIV on clearance (sqrt(omega^2) where omega^2 = 0.2)\nsigma &lt;- 0.5      # Residual unexplained variability (standard deviation)\nV &lt;- 20           # Volume of distribution (L)\nDose &lt;- 100       # Dose administered (mg)\n\n# Simulate data for one individual\nindividual_id &lt;- 1\neta_i &lt;- rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = omega)  # Individual random effect\nCL_i &lt;- theta_TVCL * exp(eta_i)          # Individual clearance\n\n# Define time points\ntime &lt;- seq(0, 10, by = 1)  # From 0 to 10 hours\n\n# Compute predicted concentrations based on the 1 cmt model\nC_pred &lt;- (Dose / V) * exp(- (CL_i / V) * time)\n\n# Add residual unexplained variability\nepsilon_ij &lt;- rnorm(length(time), mean = 0, sd = sigma)\nC_obs &lt;- C_pred + epsilon_ij\n\n# Create a data frame\nind_lvl_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Time = time,\n  Predicted = C_pred,\n  Observed = C_obs\n)\n\n# Compute the upper and lower bounds for the normal distribution around prediction\nind_lvl_data &lt;- ind_lvl_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Upper = Predicted + sigma,\n    Lower = Predicted - sigma\n  )\n\n# Create the ggplot\np &lt;- ggplot(ind_lvl_data, aes(x = Time)) +\n  # Shaded area for normal distribution around prediction\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  # Predicted concentration line\n  geom_line(aes(y = Predicted), color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  # Observed data points\n  geom_point(aes(y = Observed), color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  # Labels and theme\n  labs(\n    title = \"Individual level\",\n    x = \"Time (hours)\",\n    y = \"Concentration (mg/L)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  # Adjusted annotation for f(x)\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6, y = 1.8, label = \"f(x): Predicted Concentration\", color = \"black\", hjust = 0) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 7.2, y = 1.6, xend = 6, yend = 0.5),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), color = \"black\") +\n  # Adjusted annotation for Y_ij\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2, y = 4.15, label = \"Yij: Observed Concentration\", color = \"red\", hjust = 0) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 2, y = 4.1, xend = 1.1, yend = 4.15),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), color = \"red\") +\n  # Adjusted annotation for Residual Variability\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.8, y = 0.6, label = \"Residual Unexplained Variability (σ)\", color = \"blue\", hjust = 0.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 2, y = 0.8, xend = 3, yend = 1),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), color = \"blue\") +\n  # Add a legend manually\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Components\",\n    values = c(\"lightblue\" = \"lightblue\"),\n    labels = c(\"±1σ around Prediction\")\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 0.5)))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,2))\n\n# Display the plot\nprint(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Illustrative example of observed and predicted concentrations at the individual level, with residual unexplained variability shown as the shaded area around predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows exemplary shows the predicted and observed concentrations as well as the residual unexplained variability around the prediction.

    "text": "5.2 Maximum likelihood estimation\nIn our case, we have only two parameters to estimate: \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\). The overall goal is to infer the parameters of interest \\((\\hat{\\theta}_{TVCL}, \\hat{\\omega^2})\\) from our observed data \\(y_{1:n}\\). In this case, \\(y_{1}\\) would denote the vector of \\(m_i\\) observations for the first individual out of n total individuals. Ideally, we would like to infer the parameters by directly maximizing the complete data log-likelihood (\\(\\ln L\\)) function:\n\\[(\\hat{\\theta}_{TVCL}, \\hat{\\omega^2})_{ML} = \\underset{\\theta_{TVCL},~ \\omega^2}{\\mathrm{argmax}}~\\ln L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}, CL_{i:n}\\right) \\tag{3}\\]\nTo align more with the notation in Wang (2007), we can re-write the expression based on \\(\\eta_i\\) values instead of \\(CL_i\\). We can re-write:\n\\[(\\hat{\\theta}_{TVCL}, \\hat{\\omega^2})_{ML} = \\underset{\\theta_{TVCL},~ \\omega^2}{\\mathrm{argmax}}~\\ln L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}, \\eta_{i:m}\\right) \\tag{4}\\]\nPlease note that Equation 3 and Equation 4 represent the complete data log-likelihood, but more to that later in Section 5.2.2. The reason why we deal with log-likelihood is that it makes a lot of calculations a bit easier (e.g., products become sums). Furthermore, likelihood terms can become very small and this can lead to numerical difficulties. By taking the logarithm, we can avoid this issue.\nBefore we continue, let’s first remind ourselves what likelihood is all about and what is the difference compared to probability.\n\n5.2.1 Likelihood vs probability\nI personally see the difference between likelihood and probability as a matter of from which “direction” we are looking at the things. Probability is about looking forward (into the future): “If we have a fully specified model and set of parameters, what are the probabilities of certain future events happening?”. On the other hand, Likelihood is about looking backward: “Now that we have the data / made that particular observation, what is the most likely model or parameters that could have produced it?”\nLet’s take a simple example to visualize the likelihood. We assume that the height of a human being is normally distributed and we randomly picked a guy on the streets with a height of 180 cm. Which set of parameters is more likely to lead to this height measurement? A set of parameters that assumes a mean height of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 30 cm or a set of parameters that assumes a mean height of 190 cm and a standard deviation of 5 cm?\n\n\nCode\n# Define the parameter sets\nparams &lt;- data.frame(\n  parameter_set = c(\"Mean = 175 cm, SD = 30 cm\", \"Mean = 190 cm, SD = 5 cm\"),\n  mean = c(175, 190),\n  sd = c(30, 5)\n)\n\n# Define the range of heights for plotting\nx_values &lt;- seq(100, 250, by = 0.1)\n\n# Generate density data for each parameter set\ndensity_data &lt;- params |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  do(data.frame(\n    parameter_set = .$parameter_set,\n    x = x_values,\n    density = dnorm(x_values, mean = .$mean, sd = .$sd)\n  )) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Calculate the density (likelihood) at 180 cm for each parameter set\nlikelihoods &lt;- params |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(density_at_180 = dnorm(180, mean = mean, sd = sd)) |&gt;\n  select(parameter_set, density_at_180)\n\n# Merge the likelihoods with the density data for plotting\ndensity_data &lt;- density_data |&gt;\n  left_join(likelihoods, by = \"parameter_set\")\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(density_data, aes(x = x, y = density)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkblue\") +  # Plot the density curves\n  facet_wrap(~ parameter_set, ncol = 1) +  # Create separate panels\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 180, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +  # Dashed line at 180 cm\n  geom_point(data = likelihoods, aes(x = 180, y = density_at_180), color = \"blue\", size = 2, pch = 8) +  # Point at 180 cm\n  geom_text(data = likelihoods,\n            aes(x = 180, y = density_at_180,\n                label = sprintf(\"Likelihood: %.5f\", density_at_180)),\n            hjust = 1.1, vjust = -0.5, color = \"blue\") +  # Likelihood label on the left\n  labs(title = \"Likelihood of Observing a Height of 180 cm\",\n       x = \"Height (cm)\",\n       y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_bw()  # Apply black-and-white theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Comparison of likelihoods for observing a height of 180 cm under two parameter sets: (1) mean = 175 cm, SD = 30 cm and (2) mean = 190 cm, SD = 5 cm.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the parameters \\(\\mu = 175~cm\\) and \\(\\sigma = 30~cm\\) are more likely to have produced the observed height of 180 cm than the alternative set of parameters. The likelihood can be calculated with its respective probability density or probability mass function. More to that later. What becomes clear is that the concept of likelihood fundamentally requires observed data to be meaningful. And this fact leads to an issue when trying to calculate the joint likelihood for our NLME model.\n\n\n5.2.2 The problem with the joint likelihood\nWe are trying to estimate the joint log-likelihood \\(\\ln L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}, \\eta_{i:n}\\right)\\), which is the likelihood of the parameters \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) given that we have observed \\(y_{1:n}\\) and \\(\\eta_{i:n}\\). Now we have a problem. While we directly observe \\(y_{1:n}\\), we do not observe \\(\\eta_i\\) (or its respective \\(CL_i\\)) values directly. In other words: You will never receive a dataset where you have an “observed” individual clearance or an “observed” individual random effect parameter. This is why \\(\\eta_i\\) can be called an unobserved latent variable. Previously we have defined the complete data log-likelihood in Equation 3 and Equation 4, which is the log-likelihood of both the observed data and the unobserved latent variables. But without observations for \\(\\eta_{i:n}\\) we cannot compute the complete data likelihood.\nNow what? Our approach would be to somehow get rid of the general dependence on \\(\\eta_i\\). This is where the so-called marginal likelihood comes into play, which does not longer depend on an \\(\\eta_i\\) observation. In our case the maximum likelihood estimates are based on the marginal likelihood:\n\\[(\\hat{\\theta}_{TVCL}, \\hat{\\omega^2})_{ML} = \\underset{\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2}{\\mathrm{argmax}}~\\ln L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}\\right) \\tag{5}\\]\nPlease note that we do not depend on an actual \\(\\eta_{i:n}\\) observation anymore, only on \\(y_{1:n}\\). To set up the actual equation let’s first rewrite the Likelihood as a probability:\n\\[L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}\\right) = p(y_{1:n}; \\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2) \\tag{6}\\]\nAssuming that the observations \\(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\\) are independent, the likelihood can be expressed as the product of the individual likelihoods:\n\\[L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_{i}; \\theta_{TVCL},~ \\omega^2) \\tag{7}\\]\nFor each individual, we have \\(m_i\\) observations and \\(y_{i}\\) represents a vector of these \\(m_i\\) observations. We can also write it more explicitly to avoid misunderstandings, again assuming independence across observations.\n\\[L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^{m_i}  p(y_{ij}; \\theta_{TVCL},~ \\omega^2) \\tag{8}\\]\nTo align the likelihood expression with the structure of our model in Equation 1 and Equation 2, we need to reformulate Equation 8 to explicitly include the individual random effects \\(\\eta_i\\). This allows us to express the likelihood in terms of both the individual-level and population-level components, with which we can actually do calculations. In other words: Equation 8 does not yet reflect the specific hierarchical form of our model. By reformulating the likelihood (see next steps), we transform this generic form into a structure that directly incorporates our model’s individual and population components and allows us to use our previously specified model.\n\\[L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\int \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{m_i} p(y_{ij}, \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2) \\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{9}\\]\nIn this first step, we are integrating over all possible values of \\(\\eta_i\\) (since we can’t directly observe \\(\\eta_i\\)). We can now further split this marginal likelihood equation by using the chain rule of probability, which brings us closer to the population and individual level structure of our model and closer to a state where we can use the model:\n\\[L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\int \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{m_i} p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2)\\right) \\cdot p(\\eta_i | \\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{10}\\]\nAs \\(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2)\\) does not actually depend on \\(\\omega^2\\), and \\(p(\\eta_i | \\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2)\\) does not actually depend on \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\), we can then simplify the equation to:\n\\[L\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{1:n}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n  \\int \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{m_i} p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) \\cdot p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{11}\\]\nThe integral now consists of two parts: The individual level term \\(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\) and the population level term \\(p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2)\\). The intuition behind this can be seen as something like this: For a given \\(\\eta_i\\) within the integral, the population term \\(p(\\eta_i |\\omega^2)\\) tells us how likely it is to observe this particular \\(\\eta_i\\) value in the population. The individual term \\(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\) on the other hand tells us how likely it is to observe the \\(j^{th}\\) observation of the \\(i^{th}\\) individual given that particular \\(\\eta_i\\) value. The Likelihood will be maximal when the product of both terms is maximal, so that it is very likely to have this particular \\(\\eta_i\\) value in the population and that it is very likely to observe the set of \\(y_{ij}\\) values given this \\(\\eta_i\\) value.\nSo is it all good now? Kind of. We got rid of the dependence on directly observing \\(\\eta_i\\) for the complete data log-likelihood and have instead a nice marginal likelihood equation. However, solving the marginal likelihood is much harder due to this complex integral. So the next important task is to find a way to deal with this integral. And if it is hard to calculate, why not just approximate it?"

    "text": "5.3 Approximating the integral\n\n5.3.1 Laplacian approximation\nSo far we’ve understood that we cannot solve the integral in the marginal likelihood equation easily. I am not sure if it is impossible or if it is just very hard to do so. But either way, in reality we need to approximate it somehow. To simplify things a bit, we will focus on the individual Likelihood \\(L_i\\) for now (for one single individual i) to avoid writing out the product (for the population) every time:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{m_i} p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) \\cdot p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{12}\\]\nIn the end, we have to take the product of all individual Likelihoods to get the likelihood for the population. Now we are going to tackle the integral. Apparently, one way of approximating integrals is the Laplacian approximation. It is a method which simplifies difficult integrals by focusing on the most important part (contribution-wise) of the function being integrated, which is the point where the function reaches its peak (the maximum or mode of the function). The idea is to approximate the function around this maximum point by a so-called second-order Taylor expansion. This approximation assumes that the integrand behaves like a Gaussian (bell-shaped) function around its maximum. The Taylor expansion with different orders (n = 1/2/3/10) is visualized here (2024):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Visualization of second-order Taylor expansions (n=1,2,3,10) around the logarithmic function ln(x).\n\n\n\nNow, there seems to exist an useful feature of integrals that they often become analytically solvable if they take a certain form. If we can express the integral in the following exponential form:\n\\[\\int{\\exp(f(x))~dx} \\tag{13}\\]\nwhere \\(f(x)\\) is a second-order polynomial of the form \\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\) with a negative quadratic coefficient (\\(a &lt; 0\\)), and \\(f(x)\\) is twice differentiable with a unique maximum, we can solve it analytically. Therefore, the next step would be to bring our integral into this form, so we can make use of this nice property to kick out the annoying integral. That would allow us to get rid of any integration and just directly deal with the analytical solution.\n\n\n5.3.2 Bringing the expression in the right form\nTo bring our Likelihood expression into the right form, we can use a \\(\\exp(\\ln())\\) operator. In total this won’t do anything, but it allows us to simplify our inner expression a little, as products turn into sums due to the logarithm. And (as mentioned above), we need the exponential form of Equation 13 to solve the integral analytically. Thus, we take Equation 12 and apply the \\(\\exp(\\ln())\\) operator, which leads to a re-expression of the individual Likelihood as:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp \\left(\\ln \\left(\\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{m_i} p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\cdot p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{14}\\]\nAfter applying the log to each element, we get a sum:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp \\left(\\ln \\left(\\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{m_i} p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right)\\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{15}\\]\nAlso the product sum of the individual level term turns into a sum:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp \\left( \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{16}\\]\nWe can now substitute the inner term with a function \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\), which allows us to write:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp\\left(g_i(\\eta_i)\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{17}\\]\nwith\n\\[g_i(\\eta_i) = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2)\\right) \\tag{18}\\]\nWe have successfully brought our expression into a format which allows us to later get rid of the integral itself. Please note the similarity between Equation 13 and Equation 17. In a next step we want to approximate \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\) as a Gaussian (second-order polynomial) function around its maximum point (mode) \\(\\eta_i^*\\) via a Taylor expansion.\n\n\n5.3.3 Taylor expansion\nOkay, let’s approximate \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\) by a second order Taylor expansion of \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\) at point \\(\\eta_i^*\\), as we cannot explicitly and directly calculate that integral1. A second-order Taylor expansion at point \\(\\eta_i^*\\) is given by the following expression:\n\\[g_i(\\eta_i) \\approx g_i(\\eta_i^*) + g_i'(\\eta_i^*) \\cdot (\\eta_i - \\eta_i^*) + \\frac{1}{2} g_i''(\\eta_i^*)(\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2 \\tag{19}\\]\nDuring Laplacian estimation, we want to choose \\(\\eta_i^*\\) so that we are in the mode of \\(g_i\\). First of all, around this point we have the biggest contribution to the integral. Since a Taylor approximation is always most accurate at the point for which we are expanding it, it makes sense that this should be the point at which the integral is the most sensitive to. Second, the mode is the point where the first derivative (\\(g_i'(\\eta_i^*)\\)) is zero. Therefore, it allows us to drop the second term of the Taylor expansion:\n\\[g_i(\\eta_i) \\approx g_i(\\eta_i^*) + \\frac{1}{2} g_i''(\\eta_i^*)(\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2 \\tag{20}\\]\ngiven that\n\\[\\eta_i^* = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\left[g_i(\\eta_i)\\right] = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right] \\tag{21}\\]\nGreat! Now we have approximated the complex expression \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\) and can now try to get rid of the integral in a next step.\n\n\n5.3.4 Kicking out the integral\nOkay, so the first thing we do is to take Equation 17 and substitute \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\) with the 2nd-order approximation we obtained via Equation 20. This gives us:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp\\left(g_i(\\eta_i^*) + \\frac{1}{2} g_i''(\\eta_i^*)(\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{22}\\]\nOur first goal is to isolate expressions which are dependent on \\(\\eta_i\\) and those which are not. This will later allow us to get rid of the integral. The term \\(g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\) is independent on \\(\\eta_i\\) (it is just being evaluated at the mode \\(\\eta_i^*\\)), while the term \\(\\frac{1}{2} g_i''(\\eta_i^*)(\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\) is actually dependent on \\(\\eta_i\\). Therefore, we are now going to split the expression into two parts:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp\\left(g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{2} g_i''(\\eta_i^*)(\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{23}\\]\nNow in order that our plan (kicking out the integral) works, we need to ensure that the exponent of the second term is negative. This is important, because we want to approximate the integral as a Gaussian function, which is only possible if this exponent is negative. Technically, we can be sure that this is the case, because we are expanding around the mode and the second derivative at this point is negative for our function. However, since I want to align more with the reference solution in Wang (2007), I re-write the expression in a way that makes this more explicit:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp\\left(g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{24}\\]\nWe just introduced a negative sign and took the absolute value of the second derivative. Now we can substitute \\(g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\) with the respective expression given in Equation 18 (and evaluated at the mode \\(\\eta_i^*\\)) and get:\n\\[\\begin{split} L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\int \\exp\\left(\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^* | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\cdot \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\end{split} \\tag{25}\\]\nNow the term \\(\\exp\\left(\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^* | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right)\\) does not depend anymore on \\(\\eta_i\\) (over which we are integrating), since the expression is just evaluated at a given value of \\(\\eta_i^*\\). This means it is a constant and can be factored out of the integral:\n\\[ \\begin{split}  L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^* | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right) \\\\ \\cdot\\int  \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\end{split} \\tag{26}\\]\nRemember the trick we have used to bring the integral in the right form? This operator \\(\\exp(\\ln())\\) is not needed for the term which has been factored out, so we can simplify it to \\(\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{m_i}  p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) \\cdot p(\\eta_i^* | \\omega^2)\\). Please note, that the summation becomes a product again as we transform to the normal domain:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{m_i}  p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) \\cdot p(\\eta_i^* | \\omega^2) \\cdot \\int \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{27}\\]\nNow the whole plan of those people, who came up with this derivation, works out: The remaining integral is the integral of a Gaussian function and can be solved analytically. We now shortly just focus on the integral part of Equation 27:\n\\[\\int \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i \\tag{28}\\]\nIn general, a Gaussian integral has the following form (and analytical solution):\n\\[\\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right) dx = \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} \\tag{29}\\]\nTo see how our expression fits this form, we notice that\n\\[-\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2 \\tag{30}\\]\ncan be written as \\(-\\frac{1}{2} x^2\\) via the substitution\n\\[x = \\sqrt{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|} (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*), ~~ d\\eta_i = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}} \\cdot dx \\tag{31}\\]\nHence, we obtain:\n\\[\\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2 \\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i = \\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} x^2\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}} dx \\tag{32}\\]\nwhich evaluates to\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 \\pi} = \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}} \\tag{33}\\]\nFinally the magic happens. With all the work we have invested we can finally harvest the fruits. The integral disappears and we are left with a simple expression.\n\\[\\int \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right| (\\eta_i-\\eta_i^*)^2\\right) \\cdot d\\eta_i = \\sqrt{2\\pi\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|} } = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}} \\tag{34}\\]\nTo my understanding we have now achieved an important goal by turning a hard-to calculate integral into an analytical expression, which is easier to evaluate. The only challenge remaining is the calculation of the second derivative \\(g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\), which is not very straightforward. Substituting the simplified integral part from Equation 34 back into our individual likelihood expression (Equation 27), we get:\n\\[L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) = \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{m_i}  p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) \\cdot p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2) \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}} \\tag{35}\\]\nAlso here, we need to be careful. As mentioned above, \\(g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\) is expected to be negative, since the function is concave and has a negative curvature at their maximum. I saw in Wang (2007) that they write \\(-g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\), however, this should be the same as \\(|g_i''(\\eta_i^*)|\\) and I am going to stick to the absolute value out of convenience and because I find it a bit easier to follow.\nNow we can move a step further and translate it into something which is more familiar to us: The objective function in NONMEM. In the next section, we are going to spell out the missing expressions and also define the actual equation for the second derivative \\(g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\)."

    "section": "5.4 Defining the Objective Function",
    "text": "5.4 Defining the Objective Function\n\n5.4.1 General\nOkay, so our next task is to define the objective function in NONMEM. We know that NONMEM calculates the -2 log likelihood (Bauer 2020). To my understanding the main reason to use the log of the Likelihood is to make it numerically more stable and the main reason to take the -2 is to make it asymptotically chi-square distributed (and thus, it allows some statistical testing). The negative sign turns our maximization problem into a minimization problem, which is mathematically easier to solve. The -2 log likelihood for a single individual is defined as:\n\\[OF_i = -2\\ln L_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2| y_{i}\\right) \\tag{36}\\]\nFor the sake of simplicity we are still focusing on a single individual \\(i\\) and its contribution to the objective function. In the end, we would have to sum up the individual contributions to the objective function \\(OF_i\\) to get the final objective function. When we substitute the individual likelihood from Equation 35 into Equation 36, we get:\n\\[OF_i = -2\\ln\\left(\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{m_i}  p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) \\cdot p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2) \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) \\tag{37}\\]\nWe can apply the \\(-2\\ln()\\) operation to each element and are left with:\n\\[OF_i = -2 \\ln \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{m_i}  p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) -2 \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right) -2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) \\tag{38}\\]\nThis can be re-written as:\n\\[OF_i = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} -2  \\ln\\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) -2 \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right) -2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) \\tag{39}\\]\nFrom here on it makes sense to split up the terms in order to better understand what is going on. We can identify three terms in the expression given by Equation 39:\n\nFirst term: \\(\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} -2 \\ln\\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right)\\)\nSecond term: \\(-2 \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right)\\)\nThird term: \\(-2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right)\\)\n\nLet’s spell out each of these terms in more detail and see how they can be calculated.\n\n\n5.4.2 Term 1\nLet’s tackle the first term of Equation 39. It is given by:\n\\[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} -2  \\ln\\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) \\tag{40}\\]\nThe question we are asking is: “How likely is it to observe a certain set of data points \\(y_i\\) (= a series of observations for an individual) given the individual (most likely) parameter \\(\\eta_i^*\\) and \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\)?” Please note: It seems that this expression is independent of \\(\\omega^2\\), but it is not. Our most likely \\(\\eta_i^*\\) is the mode of the distribution characterized by \\(\\omega^2\\), so we have a hidden dependence here. Typically, the our first term would also involve the residual unexplained variance (RUV) given by \\(\\sigma^2\\), but in our simple example it is fixed to a certain variance and thus, we don’t have to estimate it.\nWe assume a normal distribution (given by the RUV) around our model predictions \\(f(x_{ij}; \\theta_i)\\). Please refer to Figure 7 for a refresher. Now we can illustrate this concept for one single data point of a single individual (e.g., after 10 h a concentration of 2 mg/L was measured) as a case example to understand the concept a bit better:\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility (optional)\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Define fixed parameters\nDose &lt;- 100            # Dose administered\nV_D &lt;- 10              # Volume of distribution\neta_i &lt;- 0             # Individual random effect\nsigma &lt;- sqrt(0.1)     # Residual unexplained variance (standard deviation)\n\n# Define population parameters (Theta_TVCL)\nTheta_TVCL_values &lt;- c(10, 15, 20)\n\n# Define fixed time point (t)\nt &lt;- 1  # You can change this as needed\n\n# Compute the structural model predictions for each Theta_TVCL\n# Using the formula: C(t) = (Dose / V_D) * exp(-Theta_TVCL / V_D * t)\nmodel_predictions &lt;- data.frame(\n  Theta_TVCL = Theta_TVCL_values,\n  C_t = (Dose / V_D) * exp(-Theta_TVCL_values / V_D * t)\n)\n\n# Define the observed data point y_i\ny_i &lt;- 2\n\n# Create a sequence of y values for plotting the PDFs\ny_values &lt;- seq(min(model_predictions$C_t) - 3*sigma, \n               max(model_predictions$C_t) + 3*sigma, \n               length.out = 1000)\n\n# Create a data frame with density values for each Theta_TVCL\ndensity_data &lt;- model_predictions |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  do(data.frame(\n    Theta_TVCL = .$Theta_TVCL,\n    y = y_values,\n    density = dnorm(y_values, mean = .$C_t, sd = sigma)\n  )) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Calculate the likelihood and -2 log likelihood for the observed y_i\nlikelihood_data &lt;- model_predictions |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    likelihood = dnorm(y_i, mean = C_t, sd = sigma),\n    neg2_log_likelihood = -2 * log(likelihood)\n  )\n\n# Merge likelihood data with density_data for annotation purposes\ndensity_data &lt;- density_data |&gt;\n  left_join(likelihood_data, by = \"Theta_TVCL\")\n\n# Create a named vector for custom facet labels\nfacet_labels &lt;- setNames(\n  paste(\"TVCL =\", Theta_TVCL_values),\n  Theta_TVCL_values\n)\n\n# Start plotting\nggplot(density_data, aes(x = y, y = density)) +\n  # Plot the density curves\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  \n  # Add a vertical line for the observed data point y_i\n  geom_vline(xintercept = y_i, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  \n  # Facet the plot by Theta_TVCL\n  facet_wrap(~ Theta_TVCL, scales = \"free_y\", labeller = as_labeller(facet_labels), nrow=3) +\n  \n  # Add annotations for the likelihood and -2 log likelihood\n  geom_text(data = density_data |&gt; distinct(Theta_TVCL, likelihood, neg2_log_likelihood),\n            aes(x = Inf, y = Inf, \n                label = paste0(\"Likelihood: \", round(likelihood, 6),\n                               \"\\n-2 ln(L): \", round(neg2_log_likelihood, 3))),\n            hjust = 1.1, vjust = 1.1, size = 4, color = \"black\") +\n  \n  # Customize labels and theme\n  labs(\n    title = \"Likelihood for different TVCL values\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"Observed data point yi =\", y_i, \", eta_i* = 0\"),\n    x = \"Concentration (C(t))\",\n    y = \"Probability Density\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(NA, 2))+\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Likelihood of observing a concentration of 2 mg/L at different typical clearance values.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor simplicity we have assumed an \\(\\eta_i^*\\) of 0 to generate this plot. We can see that we have observed a concentration of 2 mg/L at a given time point and want to know how likely it is to observe this particular concentration given different values of \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\) with a fixed \\(\\eta_i^*\\). It becomes apparent that it is much more likely to have a clearance of 15 L/h given our data than to have a clearance of 10 or 20 L/h. But how can we explicitly calculate that likelihood given by Equation 40?\nSince we deal with a normal distribution, the likelihood is given by its probability density function (PDF). The general form is given by:\n\\[pdf(\\text{obs}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}}\\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\text{obs} - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\tag{41}\\]\nIn our case we would re-write it as follows for a single observation \\(y_{ij}\\):\n\\[p(y_{ij} | \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\tag{42}\\]\nTaking the log leads to:\n\\[\\ln \\left(p(y_{ij} | \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\tag{43}\\]\nMultiplying with -2 and simplifying leads to:\n\\[-2 \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}  | \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right) = \\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) + \\frac{(y_{ij}  - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2}{\\sigma^2} \\tag{44}\\]\nIn a last step, we would have to take the sum of all observations to consider the likelihood contributions of all datapoints:\n\\[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} -2  \\ln\\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) + \\frac{(y_{ij}  - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right] \\tag{45}\\]\nGreat! If someone would give us a \\(\\theta_{TVCL}\\) value and an \\(\\eta_i^*\\) value, we would be able to calculate the -2 log likelihood term for that particular data point. Actually, we would need to have the model prediction function at hand for this (or an ODE-solver). The model prediction \\(f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\) was already defined in Equation 69 (see above). It will be used at various points of the final objective function.\n\n\n5.4.3 Term 2\nA very similar concept applies to the second term of Equation 39. It is given by:\n\\[-2 \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right) \\tag{46}\\]\nWe typically assume that \\(\\eta_i\\) is normally distributed with a mean of 0 with a variance \\(\\omega^2\\). We could do a similar illustration as above, where we have a look at a certain \\(\\eta_i^*\\) value and want to know how likely it is to observe this value given the population variance \\(\\omega^2\\) (which we have at the moment of evaluation):\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducibility (optional)\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Define fixed parameters\neta_i_star &lt;- 0.3          # Observed eta_i value\nomega_squared_values &lt;- c(0.01, 0.2, 0.5)  # Population variances\n\n# Define the mean for eta_i (assumed to be 0)\nmu_eta &lt;- 0\n\n# Compute the structural model predictions for each omega^2\n# Using the formula: eta_i ~ N(0, omega^2)\nmodel_predictions &lt;- data.frame(\n  omega_squared = omega_squared_values,\n  mean = mu_eta\n)\n\n# Create a sequence of eta values for plotting the PDFs\n# Extending the range to cover the tails adequately\neta_values &lt;- seq(\n  mu_eta - 4 * sqrt(max(omega_squared_values)), \n  mu_eta + 4 * sqrt(max(omega_squared_values)), \n  length.out = 1000\n)\n\n# Create a data frame with density values for each omega^2\ndensity_data &lt;- model_predictions |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  do(data.frame(\n    omega_squared = .$omega_squared,\n    eta = eta_values,\n    density = dnorm(eta_values, mean = .$mean, sd = sqrt(.$omega_squared))\n  )) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Calculate the likelihood and -2 log likelihood for the observed eta_i*\nlikelihood_data &lt;- model_predictions |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    likelihood = dnorm(eta_i_star, mean = mean, sd = sqrt(omega_squared)),\n    neg2_log_likelihood = -2 * log(likelihood)\n  )\n\n# Merge likelihood data with density_data for annotation purposes\ndensity_data &lt;- density_data |&gt;\n  left_join(likelihood_data, by = \"omega_squared\")\n\n# Create a named vector for custom facet labels\nfacet_labels &lt;- setNames(\n  paste(\"ω² =\", omega_squared_values),\n  omega_squared_values\n)\n\n# Start plotting\nggplot(density_data, aes(x = eta, y = density)) +\n  # Plot the density curves\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  \n  # Add a vertical line for the observed eta_i*\n  geom_vline(xintercept = eta_i_star, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  \n  # Highlight the point (eta_i*, density at eta_i*)\n  geom_point(\n    data = density_data |&gt; filter(abs(eta - eta_i_star) &lt; 1e-6), \n    aes(x = eta, y = density), \n    color = \"darkgreen\", size = 3  \n  ) +\n  \n  # Facet the plot by omega_squared with custom labels\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~ omega_squared, \n    scales = \"free_y\",\n    labeller = as_labeller(facet_labels),\n    nrow=3\n  ) +\n  \n  # Add annotations for the likelihood and -2 log likelihood\n  geom_text(\n    data = likelihood_data,\n    aes(\n      x = Inf, y = Inf, \n      label = paste0(\n        \"Likelihood: \", round(likelihood, 4),\n        \"\\n-2 log(L): \", round(neg2_log_likelihood, 2)\n      )\n    ),\n    hjust = 1.1, vjust = 1.1, size = 4, color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  \n  # Customize labels and theme\n  labs(\n    title = \"Likelihood term for different ω² values\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"etai* =\", eta_i_star),\n    x = expression(eta),\n    y = \"Probability Density\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(NA, 4.5))+\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Likelihood of observing ETA=0.3 for different variances of the inter-individual variability term.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our little example we can observe that the likelihood of “observing”2 \\(\\eta_i^* = 0.3\\) is much higher when the IIV variance is 0.2 compared to 0.01 or 0.5. This is the information we want to capture with this second likelihood term. Similarly to the first term of Equation 39, we are applying the general form of the pdf (Equation 41), which leads to this expression:\n\\[p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\omega^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\eta_i^* - 0)^2}{2\\omega^2}\\right) \\tag{47}\\]\nPlease note that the normal distribution is centered around 0 (\\(\\mu = 0\\)), which is in contrast to the individual level where it was centered around the predicted value \\(f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\) (see Equation 42). Because of \\(\\mu = 0\\), we can simplify this to:\n\\[p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\omega^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\eta_i^{*2}}{2\\omega^2}\\right) \\tag{48}\\]\nTaking the log:\n\\[\\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2\\pi\\omega^2) - \\frac{\\eta_i^{*2}}{2\\omega^2} \\tag{49}\\]\nMultiplying with -2 and simplifying:\n\\[-2 \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right) = \\ln(2\\pi\\omega^2) + \\frac{\\eta_i^{*2}}{\\omega^2} \\tag{50}\\]\nVery good. We have our population-level likelihood term. Similar to Term 1, we are now able to calculate this expression if someone would give us a value for \\(\\eta_i^*\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\). The remaining term is part 3 of the objective function, which is a bit more tricky. Let’s move on to this term.\n\n\n5.4.4 Term 3\nThe derivative term is the third and last term of Equation 39 and is given by\n\\[-2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) \\tag{51}\\]\nWe can take the square root out of the logarithm:\n\\[-2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) = -2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\ln \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}\\right) \\tag{52}\\]\nWhich can be simplified to:\n\\[-2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) = - \\ln \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}\\right) \\tag{53}\\]\nThis expression can be further simplified by applying log-rules to:\n\\[-2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) = - \\ln \\left(2\\pi\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\left|g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|\\right) \\tag{54}\\]\nWe still need to find a way to calculate the second derivative of the individual model function \\(g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\). However, defining the second derivative \\(g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\) evaluated at \\(\\eta_i^*\\) is not straightforward and in many cases (once we deal with more complex models), this would be approximated numerically (e.g., using finite difference methods). We have luckily chosen a very simple model and can actually calculate the second derivative of the closed form expression. However, it is still quite complicated and cumbersome (at least to me). Therefore, we will simply use WolframAlpha / Mathematica to find these derivatives and help us out with the derivation rules.\nThe function \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\) was already defined in Equation 18. Given that, the second derivative is expressed as the second derivatives of its two terms:\n\\[g_i''(\\eta_i^*) = \\left[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right)\\right]'' +  \\left[ln\\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right)\\right]'' \\tag{55}\\]\nWe will use WolframAlpha to calculate the second derivative for both parts.\n\n5.4.4.1 First part of term 3\nLet’s start with the first part, which is given by:\n\\[\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right)\\right]'' \\tag{56}\\]\nIt doesn’t matter whether we differentiate each term of a sum individually and then add the results, or add the terms first and then differentiate the sum as a whole. The result remain the same due to the linearity property of differentiation. For this reason, we first define the second derivative of a single term (by ignoring the sum). Our expression for \\(\\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\) is given in Equation 43.\nAccording to WolframAlpha, the second derivative of Equation 43 is given by:\n\\[\\begin{multline}\n\\left[\\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i^*; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right]'' = \\\\\n\\frac{-(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2 + \\left(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)}{\\sigma^2}\n\\end{multline} \\tag{57}\\]\nSubsequently, we have to take the sum of these derivatives over all \\(j\\) (see above):\n\\[\\begin{multline} \\left[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right)\\right]'' = \\\\ \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[ \\frac{-(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2 + \\left(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)}{\\sigma^2} \\right] \\end{multline} \\tag{58}\\]\nThe closed form expression for the model prediction function is defined in Equation 69. However, we haven’t defined its first and second derivative yet. Similar, we are going to use WolframAlpha to define these derivatives:\n\\[f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*) = -\\frac{\\theta_{TVCL} \\cdot t_{ij} \\cdot e^{\\eta_i^*}}{V_D} \\cdot f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*) \\tag{59}\\]\n\\[f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*) = \\frac{\\theta_{TVCL} \\cdot t_{ij} \\cdot e^{\\eta_i^*}}{V_D} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{TVCL} \\cdot t_{ij} \\cdot e^{\\eta_i^*}}{V_D} -1\\right) \\cdot f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*) \\tag{60}\\]\nThis provides us with everything we need for the first part of term 3.\n\n\n5.4.4.2 Second part of term 3\nThe second part of the second derivative is given by:\n\\[\\left[ln\\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right)\\right]'' \\tag{61}\\]\nIts full expression is given by Equation 49 and the second derivative is defined as:\n\\[\\left[ln\\left(p(\\eta_i^*|\\omega^2)\\right)\\right]'' = - \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} \\tag{62}\\]\n\n\n5.4.4.3 Combining both parts\nNow we can substitute the terms in Equation 55 to get the full expression for \\(\\left[g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\right]''\\):\n\\[\\begin{multline} \\left[g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\right]'' = \\\\ \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[ \\frac{-(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2 + \\left(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)}{\\sigma^2} \\right]\n- \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} \\end{multline} \\tag{63}\\]\nwhich depends on our previous definitions for \\(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\) in Equation 59 and \\(f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\) in Equation 60.\nNow we have to pluck our results back into Equation 54 to finalize term 3:\n\\[\\begin{multline}  -2 \\ln \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left| g_i''(\\eta_i^*)\\right|}}\\right) = - \\ln \\left(2\\pi\\right) + \\\\  \\ln\\left(\\left| \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[ \\frac{-(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2 + \\left(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)}{\\sigma^2} \\right]\n- \\frac{1}{\\omega^2}  \\right|\\right) \\end{multline} \\tag{64}\\]\nGreat! We have found the final expression for the second derivative of \\(g_i(\\eta_i^*)\\).\n\n\n\n5.4.5 Defining \\(\\eta_i^*\\)\nOur first task is to find the particular value of \\(\\eta_i\\) which maximizes the expression in Equation 18. This should be nothing else than a Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation (or empirical Bayes estimation (EBE)). We can find the mode of \\(g_i(\\eta_i)\\) by:\n\\[\\eta_i^* = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}g_i(\\eta_i) = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}  \\ln \\left(p(y_{ij}| \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\right) + \\ln \\left(p(\\eta_i | \\omega^2)\\right)\\right] \\tag{65}\\]\nThis means that we are searching over all possible values for \\(\\eta_i\\) (per individual) and try to find the value that maximizes our log likelihood function. We have already previously defined \\(\\ln\\left(p(y_{ij} | \\eta_i; \\theta_{TVCL})\\right)\\) and \\(ln\\left(p(\\eta_i|\\omega^2)\\right)\\) in Equation 43 and Equation 49, respectively3. We can substitute these expressions into Equation 65:\n\\[\\eta_i^* = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}} ~\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right] -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2\\pi\\omega^2) - \\frac{\\eta_i^{2}}{2\\omega^2}\\right] \\tag{66}\\]\nNow this is an optimization (maximization) problem, so we don’t care about the constants. This simplifies the expression to:\n\\[\\eta_i^* = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmax}} ~\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[ - \\frac{(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right]  - \\frac{\\eta_i^{2}}{2\\omega^2}\\right] \\tag{67}\\]\nMost numerical optimization algorithms are designed to minimize functions, because it is conceptually simpler to identify a minimum than a maximum. As we will later reproduce this function in R, we are already now turning the maximization problem into a minimization problem by negation:\n\\[\\eta_i^* = \\underset{\\eta_i}{\\mathrm{argmin}} ~\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[\\frac{(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right]  + \\frac{\\eta_i^{2}}{2\\omega^2}\\right] \\tag{68}\\]\nIn our simple example, we luckily do not need to rely on ODE solvers (as we have an analytical solution at hand) and can later replace \\(f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i)\\) with the closed form expression of a 1 cmt iv bolus model:\n\\[f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i) = \\frac{Dose}{V_D} \\cdot \\exp(-\\frac{\\theta_{TVCL} \\cdot e^{\\eta_{i}}}{V_D}t_{ij}) \\tag{69}\\]\nEquation 68 needs to be numerically optimized for each individual at each iteration of the algorithm. This is typically done by using a numerical optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm will search the parameter space to numerically find the value of \\(\\eta_i^*\\) that maximizes the function.\n\n\n5.4.6 Putting the pieces together\nPreviously, we have taken the three pieces of Equation 39 and expressed them in an explicit way. Let’s put them together. After simplification, our objective function is represented by:\n\\[OF_i = a + b + c \\tag{70}\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are defined based on Equation 45, Equation 50, and Equation 64:\n\\[a  = \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) + \\frac{(y_{ij}  - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right] \\tag{71}\\]\n\\[b = \\ln(2\\pi\\omega^2) + \\frac{\\eta_i^{*2}}{\\omega^2} \\tag{72}\\]\n\\[\\begin{multline} c = - \\ln \\left(2\\pi\\right) + \\\\  \\ln\\left(\\left| \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[ \\frac{-(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2 + \\left(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)}{\\sigma^2} \\right] - \\frac{1}{\\omega^2}  \\right|\\right) \\end{multline} \\tag{73}\\]\nleading to\n\\[\\begin{multline} OF_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) + \\frac{(y_{ij}  - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right] + \\ln(2\\pi\\omega^2) + \\frac{\\eta_i^{*2}}{\\omega^2}  - \\ln \\left(2\\pi\\right) +   \\\\ \\ln\\left(\\left| \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[ \\frac{-(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2 + \\left(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)}{\\sigma^2} \\right] - \\frac{1}{\\omega^2}  \\right|\\right) \\end{multline} \\tag{74}\\]\nIt seems that NONMEM ignores all constants during the optimization process (Bauer (2020) and Wang (2007)), which is why we can get rid of the \\(\\ln(2\\pi)\\) terms. We can simplify to:\n\\[\\begin{multline} OF_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[\\ln(\\sigma^2) + \\frac{(y_{ij}  - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right] + \\ln(\\omega^2) + \\frac{\\eta_i^{*2}}{\\omega^2} +   \\\\ \\ln\\left(\\left| \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left[ \\frac{-(f'(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*))^2 + \\left(y_{ij} - f(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)\\right) \\cdot f''(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i^*)}{\\sigma^2} \\right] - \\frac{1}{\\omega^2}  \\right|\\right) \\end{multline} \\tag{75}\\]\nPlease note that the objective function \\(OF_i\\) is a function with multiple input parameters. Technically, we would have to write something like this:\n\\[OF_i\\left(\\theta_{TVCL}, \\omega^2, \\sigma^2, y_i, \\eta_i^*, x_i = \\left[DOSE_i, V_D, t_i\\right]\\right) = (...)\\]\nto clearly state the dependencies. However, for the sake of readability we are simply denoting it \\(OF_i\\). The last step would be now to calculate the objective function for the whole population, including n individuals:\n\\[OF = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} OF_i \\tag{76}\\]\nVery good. We have now set up the final equation for our objective function and we can now reproduce these function in R!"

    "text": "6.1 Function definitions\nIn order to reproduce the iteration of the NONMEM algorithm, we need to define a couple of functions inside R. Technically, we need all equations which are part of Equation 75. In the next steps we are going to define these functions in R.\n\n6.1.1 Structural model function and its derivatives\nThe first function we are defining in R is Equation 69, which gives us a prediction for a given \\(x_{ij}, \\theta_{TVCL}, \\eta_i\\) based on our structural model.\n\n\n\nfunction: f_pred()\n\n# Define structural model prediction function\nf_pred &lt;- function(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t) {\n  exp_eta_i &lt;- exp(eta_i)\n  exponent &lt;- -1 * (theta_tvcl * exp_eta_i / vd) * t\n  result &lt;- (dose / vd) * exp(exponent)\n  return(result)\n}\n\n\nWe also have to define the derivatives of f_pred(). This is the definition of the first derivative function (reproduction of Equation 59):\n\n\n\nfunction: f_prime()\n\n# Define the first derivative of the structural model prediction function\nf_prime &lt;- function(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t) {\n  term &lt;- (theta_tvcl * t * exp(eta_i)) / vd\n  derivative &lt;- -term * f_pred(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t)\n  return(derivative)\n}\n\n\nThis is the definition of the second derivative function (reproduction of Equation 60):\n\n\n\nfunction: f_double_prime()\n\n# Define the second derivative of the structural model prediction function\nf_double_prime &lt;- function(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t) {\n  term &lt;- (theta_tvcl * t * exp(eta_i)) / vd\n  second_derivative &lt;- term * (term - 1) * f_pred(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t)\n  return(second_derivative)\n}\n\n\nWe now need to pay attention what R is actually returning in these functions. For all individuals we have multiple data points, so t is going to be a vector. This will propagate then throughout the calculations and the results/derivative/second_derivative object, which is being returned, will also be a vector.\n\n\n6.1.2 Function to find the mode \\(\\eta_i^*\\)\nNow we need to define two functions to reproduce Equation 68. Since finding the mode \\(\\eta_i^*\\) is an optimization problem, we need to define it’s own objective function for which we are going to numerically solve for the maximum:\n\n\n\nfunction: obj_fun_eta_i_star()\n\n# Objective function for optimization to find eta_i_star\nobj_fun_eta_i_star &lt;- function(eta_i, y_i, t, theta_tvcl, vd, dose, sigma2, omega2, f_pred) {\n  f_pred_value &lt;- f_pred(eta_i = eta_i, dose = dose, vd = vd, theta_tvcl = theta_tvcl, t = t)\n  term1 &lt;- sum((y_i - f_pred_value)^2 / (2 * sigma2))\n  term2 &lt;- eta_i^2 / (2 * omega2)\n  obj_value &lt;- term1 + term2 \n  return(obj_value)\n}\n\n\nSince our optimizer function (optim) will actually minimize the objective function, we already previously turned the objective function into a minimization problem by negation (see Section 5.4.5). In the end it doesn’t matter if we maximize the positive version of the term or if we minimize the negative version given by Equation 68. The actual optimizer is then being encoded in a separate function and takes as an argument the MAP objective function we have defined earlier:\n\n\n\nfunction: compute_eta_i_star()\n\n# Define optimizer function to find eta_i_star\ncompute_eta_i_star &lt;- function(y_i, t, theta_tvcl, vd, dose, sigma2, omega2, f_pred, eta_i_init = 0, obj_fun_eta_i_star) {\n  res &lt;- optim(\n    par = eta_i_init,\n    fn = obj_fun_eta_i_star,\n    y_i = y_i,\n    t = t,\n    theta_tvcl = theta_tvcl,\n    vd = vd,\n    dose = dose,\n    sigma2 = sigma2,\n    omega2 = omega2,\n    f_pred = f_pred,\n    method = \"BFGS\"\n  )\n  eta_i_star &lt;- res$par\n  return(eta_i_star)\n}\n\n\nPlease note that the compute_eta_i_star() function takes as arguments the functions which we have defined prior to that: f_pred() and obj_fun_eta_i_star(). Another hint: We need to find \\(\\eta_i^*\\) for each individual. That’s why we’ll apply our function compute_eta_i_star() on an individual level and it will return a single value of \\(\\eta_i^*\\). Please note that each individual has multiple observations and therefore obj_fun_eta_i_star() calculates the sum of the squared residual terms.\n\n\n6.1.3 Second derivative function\nNow we need to define an R function for the second derivative \\(g_i''(\\eta_i)\\), which is given by Equation 64. Again, we need to take the sum of the likelihood term to get a single value for each individual with multiple observations. Even with multiple observations, the prior term is only being accounted for once. This explains why with a larger number of observations the likelihood is going to dominate the prior.\n\n\n\nfunction: gi_double_prime()\n\n# Define second derivative of gi\ngi_double_prime &lt;- function(eta_i, y_i, t, theta_tvcl, vd, dose, sigma2, omega2) {\n  # Calculate f_pred, f_prime, and f_double_prime for all time points\n  f_pred_val &lt;- f_pred(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t)\n  f_prime_val &lt;- f_prime(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t)\n  f_double_prime_val &lt;- f_double_prime(eta_i, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t)\n  \n  # Compute the numerator for each observation\n  numerator &lt;- (-f_prime_val^2 + (y_i - f_pred_val) * f_double_prime_val)\n  \n  # Divide by sigma^2 for each observation\n  term &lt;- numerator / sigma2\n  \n  # Sum the terms across all observations for the individual\n  sum_term &lt;- sum(term)\n  \n  # Subtract the term 1 / omega^2\n  second_derivative &lt;- sum_term - (1 / omega2)\n  \n  # return the second derivative\n  return(second_derivative)\n}\n\n\nFrom here on, we only need to define one last function: the objective function, which brings all the pieces together.\n\n\n6.1.4 Objective function\nWhen defining the objective function (see Equation 75), we are going to rely on all other functions defined above. Please note, that the ofv_function defined below will calculate the objective function value for a single individual. Later on we will have to loop over all individuals and sum up the OFV as defined in Equation 76.\n\n\n\nfunction: ofv_function()\n\n# Define the objective function OFV\nofv_function &lt;- function(y_i, t, theta_tvcl, vd, dose, sigma2, omega2, f_pred, gi_double_prime, compute_eta_i_star, obj_fun_eta_i_star, eta_i_init = 0, return_val = \"ofv\") {\n  \n  # Compute eta_i_star\n  eta_i_star &lt;- compute_eta_i_star(\n    y_i = y_i,\n    t = t,\n    theta_tvcl = theta_tvcl,\n    vd = vd,\n    dose = dose,\n    sigma2 = sigma2,\n    omega2 = omega2,\n    f_pred = f_pred,\n    eta_i_init = eta_i_init,\n    obj_fun_eta_i_star = obj_fun_eta_i_star\n  )\n  \n  # Compute f(eta_i_star)\n  f_pred_value &lt;- f_pred(eta_i_star, dose, vd, theta_tvcl, t)\n  \n  # Compute residual term\n  residual &lt;- y_i - f_pred_value\n  residual_squared &lt;- residual^2\n  \n  # Compute the first term: ln(sigma^2)\n  term1 &lt;- length(y_i) * log(sigma2)\n  \n  # Compute the second term: (y_i - f(eta_i_star))^2 / sigma2\n  term2 &lt;- sum(residual_squared) / sigma2\n  \n  # Compute the third term: ln(omega^2)\n  term3 &lt;- log(omega2)\n  \n  # Compute the fourth term: (eta_i_star)^2 / omega2\n  term4 &lt;- (eta_i_star^2) / omega2\n  \n  # Compute gi''(eta_i_star)\n  gi_double_prime_value &lt;- gi_double_prime(\n    eta_i = eta_i_star,\n    y_i = y_i,\n    t = t,\n    theta_tvcl = theta_tvcl,\n    vd = vd,\n    dose = dose,\n    sigma2 = sigma2,\n    omega2 = omega2\n  )\n  \n  # Compute term5: ln of absolute value of gi_double_prime_value \n  term5 &lt;- log(abs(gi_double_prime_value))\n  \n  # Sum all terms to compute the objective function value\n  ofv &lt;- term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5\n  \n  # return by default ofv, but we can also request to return the eta_i_star\n  if(return_val == \"ofv\"){\n    return(ofv)\n  } else if(return_val == \"eta_i_star\"){\n    return(eta_i_star)\n  }\n}\n\n\nGreat! Now we are all set to reproduce the objective function values for each iteration."

There are some small differences, mainly associated to the fifth digit after the decimal point. Of course there is always the possibility that I have made a mistake in the implementation, but I rather expect the differences to be related to e.g., the difference between analytical solution of the second derivative and the numerical approximation in NONMEM."

    "text": "8.2 Perform estimation\nTo perform the estimation, we will pass the param_est_obj() function to optim function in R. For this part, we will select initial values that are close to the actual parameter estimates and additionally apply lower and upper bounds using the L-BFGS-B method. While playing around with the initial values, it became evident that the optim function and our current setup are considerably more sensitive to initial values than NONMEM. When the initial values were too far from the true estimates or when the optimizer was run without boundaries, I often encountered numerical issues, leading to termination of the estimation process. In contrast, NONMEM proved to be significantly more robust, suggesting that its optimizer is finely tuned for the pharmacometric problems we typcially face. In contrast, optim is rather a general purpose optimizer.\n\n\nCode\n# Starting guesses for theta_tvcl and omega2\ninitials &lt;- c(0.2, 0.1) \n\n# perform estimation\noptim_res &lt;- optim(\n  par     = initials,\n  fn      = param_est_obj,\n  sim_data_reduced = sim_data_reduced,\n  VD      = ext_file$V |&gt; unique(),\n  DOSE    = DOSE,\n  RUV_VAR = ext_file$RUV_VAR |&gt; unique(),\n  f_pred  = f_pred,\n  gi_double_prime         = gi_double_prime,\n  compute_eta_i_star= compute_eta_i_star,\n  obj_fun_eta_i_star= obj_fun_eta_i_star,\n  method  = \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  lower   = rep(0.001, length(initials)),\n  upper   = rep(1000, length(initials)),\n  hessian = TRUE,\n  control = list(\n    maxit = 10000,           \n    factr = 1e-7,           \n    pgtol = 1e-7,           \n    trace = 1,              \n    REPORT = 1              \n  )\n)\n\n\niter    1 value -12.819995\niter    2 value -12.822838\niter    3 value -12.824104\niter    4 value -12.824484\niter    5 value -12.824594\niter    6 value -12.824594\niter    7 value -12.824594\niter    8 value -12.824594\nfinal  value -12.824594 \nconverged\n\n\nThe optimization successfully converged and we can also see the trace of the optimization problem.
